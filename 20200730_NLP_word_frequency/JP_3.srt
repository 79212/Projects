1
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,160
[Music] all right so I suggested to you last

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,089
class that human beings world as a place of action through the lens of their

3
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:26,829
social cognitive biological sub structure and I made that argument on

4
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:34,710
the basis of the supposition that our primary environment was actually other

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,259
people and I mentioned to you I believe that those other people are arranged in

6
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:46,829
hierarchies of influence and authority or power or dominance which is often how

7
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,120
its construed and that the dominance hierarchy as a structure is at least 300

8
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,459
million years old which makes it older than trees and it's

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,739
for that reason that you share the same neural biology to govern your

10
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:09,200
observations of your position in the hierarchy as lobsters do which is a

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,670
remarkable fact you know it's a remarkable that the lobster uses

12
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,509
serotonin as the mechanism to adjudicate its status position and that modifying

13
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,530
the serotonin function in the lobster can produce changes in its behavior can

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,930
can / help the logs to overcome defeat for example which is very much

15
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,630
equivalent to what happens to a human being when they take antidepressants you

16
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,750
know it's it's it's a good example of the conservation of biological structure

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,959
by evolution and another a good illustration of the continuity of life

18
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,548
on Earth it's really amazing but the other thing it is a testament to is the

19
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,159
ancient nature of the social structure now we tend to think of the social

20
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,219
structure as something other than nature right because society is I suppose

21
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:06,218
mythologically opposed it's opposed in a narrative way cultures opposed to nature

22
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:12,849
it's the town in the forest but the town has been around a long time so to speak

23
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,229
and the structure of the town is also part of nature in that the dominance

24
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,869
hierarchy is part of and because it's so ancient you have to

25
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,030
consider it as part of the mechanism that has played the role of selection in

26
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,810
the process of natural selection and so roughly seem what seems to happen is

27
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,150
that there is a plethora of dominance hierarchies especially in complex human

28
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,120
communities and many of them are masculine in structure in that their

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,530
dominance are keys that primarily men compete in or that has been the

30
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,259
historical norm and that some men rise to the top based on whatever the

31
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:02,889
dominance hierarchy is based on and they make their preferential mates and it's a

32
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:08,859
good strategy for women to engage in because why and many sorts of female

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,080
animals do precisely this is they let the male's battle it out and then pick

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,380
from the top and or often the dominant males there's no choice on the part of

35
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,829
the females it's the dominant males just chasing away the subordinate males but

36
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,960
with humans it's usually the case that the females have the opportunity to do

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,610
at least some choosing and so we have if you think about that what that implies

38
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,580
is that we have evolved to climb up dominance hierarchies and then I would

39
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,540
say it's not exactly that even because there are many different dominance

40
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,889
hierarchies and so the skills that you might use to climb up one might not be

41
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,729
necessarily the same skills that you would use to climb up another and so

42
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,419
then I would say what we have all evolved for instead and I'm still

43
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:07,000
speaking mostly on the masculine edge of things historically speaking is the

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,250
ability to climb up the set of all possible dominance hierarchies right and

45
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,709
that's that's a whole different idea it's like the averaged hierarchy across

46
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,560
vast spans of time and I think it's for that reason that we among others that we

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,009
evolve general intelligence because general intelligence is a general

48
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,980
problem-solving mechanism and it seems to be situation in depend

49
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,160
so to speak and of course there's been an arms race for the development of

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,070
intelligence between men and women because each gender has to keep up with

51
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,939
the other and women have their own dominance hierarchies there's certainly

52
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,560
no doubt about that and of course now men and women more

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,530
increasingly compete within the same hierarchies and we don't exactly know

54
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,849
how to sort that out yet because it's an extraordinarily new phenomena but in any

55
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:06,950
case because of the the permanence of the dominance hierarchy it has come to

56
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,509
be represented in fundamental narratives because human beings and this is

57
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,740
something that we share everywhere it's the thing the Wall Street bankers shares

58
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:26,040
with with the kalahari Kung Bushmen who are among the genetically speaking they

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,600
seem to be very close to what the original most original human beings were

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,990
like in Africa before the Diaspora about fifty thousand years ago but you know

61
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,410
both of those people despite their vast differences live in

62
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,430
communities that have a hierarchical structure that are composed of

63
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,430
individuals that are embedded in a natural world you know the world outside

64
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,110
of the dominant Sarki and so that's the standard human environment I would say

65
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,900
and so stories that rely on the representations of those environments

66
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:06,529
and their interactions are what you might describe as universal stories and

67
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,899
that's why people can understand them and I would say further and this is

68
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,138
drawing substantially on say derivation of the work of Carl Jung because I think

69
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,370
he delved into this more deeply than anyone else so a lot of this stuff is

70
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:29,560
quite Union in its in its origins we the commonality between human beings so you

71
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,589
know you have to have commonalities in order to communicate right axiomatic

72
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,949
commonalities because otherwise you have to explain everything and so there's

73
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,500
many things that human beings don't have to explain to one another we don't have

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,829
to explain anger we do have to explain jealousy we don't have

75
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,969
to explain fear we don't have to explain pain we don't have to explain joy we

76
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,600
don't have to explain love etc those are built into us and so there are

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,180
predicates of being human and you could say that those human predicates and the

78
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,590
standard human environment produce standard narratives and then you could

79
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:12,168
say even further and this is more of a leap I would say is that those who act

80
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:17,909
out the role of the victor in those standard narratives are precisely the

81
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:24,910
people who attain victory in life and I would say biologically defined in that

82
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,410
they make more attractive partners but also I believe that there's an alignment

83
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,910
between human well-being which is a very weak word and participation in these

84
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,199
meta narratives that drive success because well do you want to be a failure

85
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,389
or a success well you know it's hard to be a success you have to adopt a lot of

86
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,841
responsibility and so you might be willing to take your chances as a

87
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:53,269
failure but I can't exactly I'm not going to make the presumption that

88
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:58,859
that's going to put you in a situation other than one where you experienced a

89
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,680
lot of frustration anger disappointment depression pain and anxiety at the

90
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,139
bottom of the heap and so generally that's not what people are aiming for

91
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,871
although under certain circumstances if people don't like responsibility and are

92
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:23,259
willing to take their chances they might take the irresponsibility and it's

93
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,329
apparent freedoms over the necessity of thinking things through the medium and

94
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:35,250
long run anyways we stop here I suggested to you that one of the primary

95
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,038
narrative representations was the known or culture or order I think those or the

96
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,850
explored territory or the dominance arc I think those things are basically

97
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,000
interchangeable from from a representational perspective and you

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,458
know in the movie The Lion King that's represented by Pride Rock which is the

99
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,308
central place of orientation founded on Raw

100
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:03,649
which is the sort of thing that people embed their memories in that's why we

101
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,909
make sculptures and gravestones and that sort of things rock stands for permanent

102
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,078
and to have rock under your feet as to be on a solid foundation and that's a

103
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,778
pyramid in some sense in that movie and the pyramid has topped by you know the

104
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:23,139
king and queen and they're their offspring so that's that's the divine

105
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,938
couple that's one way of thinking about it and Simba of course is the newborn

106
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:34,399
hero and you know you extend that even though it's lions and drawings of lions

107
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,578
at that and animals are acting it out it's completely irrelevant to you that

108
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:43,039
those characters happen to be animated and that what you're watching is a

109
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,789
fiction so and I would say to you with regards to fiction you know you might

110
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:56,189
say well is fiction true or not and the answer to that is yes and no it's not

111
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:02,809
true in that the events portrayed in fiction occurred in the world they

112
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:08,938
didn't but they're fiction is true the same way numbers are true I would say

113
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:15,289
like you know if you have one apple and one orange and one banana the common

114
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:20,948
analogy between all of those three is one and you might say well is one as

115
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:27,799
real as one fruit is the abstraction one as real as one fruit and I would say it

116
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,539
depends on what you mean by real but representing things mathematically and

117
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,360
abstractly gives you incredible power and you could make the case that the

118
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,539
abstraction is actually more real than the phenomena that it represents and

119
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,469
certainly mathematicians would make that case they would say that mathematics is

120
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,600
in some sense more real than the phenomenal world and you know you don't

121
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,040
have to believe that mostly it's a matter of choice in some sense but you

122
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,550
can't deny the fact that an abstraction has enough reality so that if you're

123
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:06,850
proficient in using it you can really you can change the world and in and in

124
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,100
insanely powerful ways you know I mean all the computational equipment you

125
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,319
people are using or depending on the abstractions one and zero

126
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:20,059
essentially and I mean look at what emerges from that and so I would say

127
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,078
with regards to fiction if you take someone like Dostoyevsky oh I think it's

128
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,578
a favorite of mine by the way I would highly recommend that you read all five

129
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:31,708
of his great novels because they are unparalleled in their psychological

130
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:37,719
depth and so if you're interested in psychology Dostoyevsky's the person for

131
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,730
you Tolstoy is more of a sociologist but

132
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,289
Dostoyevsky man he gets right down into the bottom of the questions and messes

133
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:53,058
around transformative reading anyways Dostoyevsky's characters this character

134
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:56,639
named her skull in the Cobb is a character in crime and punishment and

135
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,339
Raskolnikov is a materialist rationalist I would say which was a rather new type

136
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,709
of person back in the 1880s and he was sort of taken by the idea that God was

137
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:15,328
dead and took and convinced himself that the only reason that he that anyone

138
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:19,508
acted in a moral way in a traditional way was because of cowardice they were

139
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:25,899
unable to remove from them the restrictions of mere convention and act

140
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:32,809
in the manner of someone who rose above the norm and so he's tortured by these

141
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:36,988
ideas he's half starving he's a law student he doesn't have enough to eat he

142
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,309
doesn't have much money and so you know he's not thinking all that clearly

143
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:44,360
either and he's got a lot of family problems his mother's sick and she can't

144
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,220
spend him send a much money and his sister is planning to engage in a

145
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,528
marriage that's loveless to someone who's rather tyrannical who he hopes

146
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:57,088
will provide the family with enough money so that he can continue in law

147
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,170
school and they write him brave letters telling him that she's very much in love

148
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,389
with this guy but he is smart enough to read between the lines and realizes that

149
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:10,589
his sister is just planning to prostitute herself in you know in an

150
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:16,259
altruistic manner he's not very happy with that and then at the same time as

151
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:22,230
all this is happening he becomes aware of this pawnbroker who he's you know

152
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,649
pawning his last possessions to and she's a horrible

153
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,428
person and not only by his estimation she pawns a lot of things for the

154
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:36,250
neighborhood and people really don't like her she's grasping and cruel and

155
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,698
deceitful and and resentful and like and she has this niece who's not very bright

156
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,719
intellectually impaired whom she basically treats as a slave and beats

157
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,379
all the time and so Raskolnikov you know involved in this mess and half starved

158
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:59,539
and a bit delirious and possessed of these strange new nihilistic ideas

159
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:04,178
decides that the best way out of this situation would be just to kill the land

160
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:10,808
let the pawnbroker take her wealth which he all she does is keep it in a chest

161
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:17,049
free the niece so that seems like a good idea so remove one apparently horrible

162
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:21,349
and useless person from the world free his sister from the necessity of this

163
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,850
loveless marriage and allow him to go to law school where he can become educated

164
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,110
and do some good for the world you know so one of the things that's lovely about

165
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,220
Dostoyevsky is that he you know when sometimes when one person is arguing

166
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,819
against another or when they're having an argument in their head they make

167
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:43,948
their opponent into a straw man which is basically they take their opponent and

168
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:48,838
curricular their perspective and try to make it as weak as possible and and

169
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,279
laugh about it and and then they come up with their argument and destroy this

170
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,178
straw man and feel that they've obtained victory but it's a very pathetic way of

171
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:04,818
thinking it's not thinking at all what thinking is is when you adopt the

172
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:09,808
opposite position from your suppositions and you make that argument as strong as

173
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:14,618
you can possibly make it and then you pit your perspective

174
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:23,298
against that that strong iron man not the straw man and you argue it out you

175
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,889
battle it out and that's what Dostoevsky does in his novels I mean he's the

176
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,499
people who stand for the antithesis of what dust is dust is he actually

177
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,670
believes are often the strongest smartest and sometimes most admirable

178
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:44,039
people in the book and so takes great moral courage to do that and

179
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,748
you know in risk Olenick oov what he wanted to do was set up a character who

180
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:53,278
had every reason to commit murder every reasonable reason philosophically

181
00:15:53,278 --> 00:16:01,009
practically ethically even well so risk Olenick off goes and he kills the old

182
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,730
lady with an axe and it doesn't go the way he expects it will because what he

183
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,308
finds out is that post murder Raskolnikov and pre murder Raskolnikov

184
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:16,798
are not the same people at all they're not even close to the same people he's

185
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:21,419
entered an entirely different universe and Dostoevsky does a lovely job of

186
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:29,750
describing that universe of horror and chaos and and and deception and and and

187
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,519
suffering and terror and all of that and he doesn't even use the money he just

188
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,789
buries it in a and an alley as fast as he can and then doesn't want anything to

189
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:43,419
do with it again and anyways the reason I'm telling you all this is potentially

190
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,578
to entice you into reading the book because it is an amazing amazing book

191
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:52,769
but also because you might say well his risk is what happened to Raskolnikov

192
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,089
true are the stories in that book true and the answer to that is well from a

193
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,799
factual perspective clearly they're untrue but then if you think of

194
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:06,959
Raskolnikov as the embodiment of a particular type of person who lived at

195
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,470
that time and the embodiment of a certain kind of ideology which had swept

196
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,620
across Europe and really invaded Russia and which was actually a precursor a

197
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,768
philosophical precursor to the Russian Revolution then Raskolnikov is more real

198
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,240
than any one person he's like a composite person he's like a person

199
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,640
who's irrelevant sees have been eliminated for the purpose of relating

200
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,950
something about the structure of the world and so I like to think of those

201
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,569
things as sort of meta real meta real they're more real than real and of

202
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:47,009
course that's what you expect people to do when they tell you about their own

203
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:53,849
lives about their own day you don't want a factual description of

204
00:17:53,849 --> 00:18:01,929
every muscle twitch you want them to distill their experiences down into the

205
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,850
gist which is the significance of the experience and the significance of the

206
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:13,058
experience is roughly what you can derive from listening to the experience

207
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:17,940
that will change the way that you look at the world and act in the world so

208
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,909
it's valuable information and they can tell you a terrible story and then that

209
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:26,480
can be valuable because that can tell you how not to look in the world look at

210
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,120
the world and act in it or they can tell you a positive story you can derive

211
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,869
benefit either way which is why we also like to go watch stories about horrible

212
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:40,449
psychopathic thugs you know and and hopefully we're learning not to be like

213
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,610
them although there are additional advantages in that you know someone you

214
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,619
might be some say that someone who is incapable of cruelty is a higher moral

215
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:55,689
being than someone who is capable of cruelty and I would say and this follows

216
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,700
young as well that that's incorrect and it's dangerously incorrect because if

217
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,819
you are not capable of cruelty you are absolutely a victim to anyone who is and

218
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:12,418
so part of the reason that people go watch anti heroes and villains is

219
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,090
because there's a part of them crying out for the incorporation of the monster

220
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,308
within them which is what gives them strength of character and self-respect

221
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:26,069
because it's impossible to respect yourself until you grow teeth and if you

222
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:30,230
grow teeth and you realize that you're somewhat dangerous and let or maybe

223
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,308
somewhat seriously dangerous and then you might be more willing to demand that

224
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:40,038
you treat yourself with respect and other people do the same thing and so

225
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,179
that doesn't mean that being cruel is better than not being cruel what it

226
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:49,850
means is that being able to be cruel and then not being cruel is better than not

227
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:53,969
being able to be cruel because in the first case you're nothing but weak and

228
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,480
naive and in the second case you're dangerous but you have it under control

229
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,470
and you know a lot of martial arts concentrate on exactly that as part of

230
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,528
their philosophy of training it's like we're not training you

231
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:14,109
to fight we're training you to be peaceful and awake and avoid fights but

232
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,779
if you happen to have to get in one and then I guess the philosophy also is is

233
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,928
that if you're competent at fighting that actually decreases the probability

234
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,990
that you're going to have to fight because when someone pushes you you'll

235
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,808
be able to respond with confidence and with any luck and this is certainly the

236
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:36,908
case with bullies with any lock a reasonable show of confidence which is

237
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:40,700
very much equivalent to the show of dominance is going to be enough to make

238
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,409
the bully back off and so the strength that you develop in your monstrousness

239
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:50,870
is actually the best guarantee of peace and that's partly why Jung believed that

240
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:55,409
it was necessary for people to integrate their shadow and he said that was a

241
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,169
terrible thing for people to attempt because the human shadow mmm which is

242
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:05,240
all those things about yourself that you don't want to realize reaches all the

243
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,058
way to hell and what he meant by that was it's through an analysis of your own

244
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:14,789
shadow that you can come to understand why other people are capable and you as

245
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,440
well of the sorts of terrible atrocities that characterize let's say the 20th

246
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,538
century and without that understanding there's no possibility of bringing it

247
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:28,599
under control when you study Nazi Germany for example or you study the

248
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,019
Soviet Union particularly under Stalin and you're asking yourself well what are

249
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,819
these perpetrators like forget about the victims let's talk about the

250
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:42,339
perpetrators the answer is they're just like you and if you don't know that that

251
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:46,699
just means that you don't know anything about people including yourself and then

252
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,700
it also means that you have to discover why they're just like you and believe me

253
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,150
that's no picnic so that's enough to traumatize people and that's partly why

254
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,149
they don't do it and it's also partly why the path to enlightenment and wisdom

255
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:06,308
is seldom trod upon because if it was all a matter of following your bliss and

256
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:10,158
doing what made you happy then everyone in the world would be a paragon of

257
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,789
wisdom but it's not that at all it's the it's a matter of facing the thing you

258
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:19,960
least want to face and everyone has that old there's this old story in King

259
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,690
Arthur where the night's go off to look for the Holy

260
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,840
Grail which is either the cup that Christ drank out of it the Last Supper

261
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,388
or the cup into which the blood that gushed from his side was poured when he

262
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:37,829
was crucified the stories vary but it's it's basically a holy object like the

263
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,619
Phoenix in some sense that's representation a representation of

264
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:47,058
transformation so it's a it's an ideal and so King Arthur's knights who sit at

265
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:51,019
a round table because they're all roughly equal go off to find the most

266
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:55,929
valuable thing and they and where do you look for the most valuable thing when

267
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,269
you don't know where it is well each of the knights looks at the forest

268
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:04,529
surrounding the castle and enters the forest at the point that looks darkest

269
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:10,808
to him and that's a good thing to understand because the gateway to wisdom

270
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:14,240
and the gateway to the development of personality which is exactly the same

271
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,429
thing is precisely through the porthole portal that you do not want to climb

272
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:23,590
through and the reason for that's actually quite technical this is a union

273
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:27,639
presupposition - is that well there's a bunch of things about you that are

274
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,840
underdeveloped and a lot of those things are because there's things you've

275
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,369
avoided looking at because you don't want to look at them and there's parts

276
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,869
of you you've avoided developing because it's hard for you to develop those parts

277
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:44,500
and so it's by virtual necessity that what you need is where you don't want to

278
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,140
look because that's where you've kept it and so and that's why there's you know

279
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,799
an idiosyncratic element of it for everyone your particular place of

280
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,940
enlightenment and terror is not going to be the same as yours except that they're

281
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,850
both places of enlightenment and terror so they're equivalent at one level of

282
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:08,000
analysis and and different than another so anyways back to the fiction and and

283
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,148
and and what it does if it distills truth and it produces characters that

284
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:19,619
are composites and the more they become composites the more they approximate a

285
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:25,589
mythological character and so they become more and more universally true

286
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,668
and more and more approximating religious deities but the problem with

287
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,759
that is they become more and more distant from individual experience and

288
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,960
so with literature there's this very tight line

289
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,250
where you need to make the character more than merely human but not so much

290
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,029
of a God that you know one of the things that happened to Superman in the 1980s

291
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,928
Superman started out he's got a heavenly set a parents by the way in an earthly

292
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,909
set of parents and he's an orphan like Harry Potter very common theme is that

293
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:02,528
when Superman first emerged he could only jump out of her buildings you know

294
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:06,788
and maybe he could stop a locomotive but by the time the 1980s rolled around like

295
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:11,710
he could juggle planets and you know swallow hydrogen bombs and you know he

296
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,808
could do anything well people stopped buying the Superman comics because how

297
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:20,158
interesting is that it's like something horrible happens and Superman deals with

298
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,419
it and something else horrible happens and Superman deals with it and it's like

299
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:30,200
that's dull he turned into such an archetype he was basically the

300
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:38,720
omniscient omnipresent omnipotent God and that's no fun it's like God wins and

301
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,379
then God wins again and then again God wins and you know so then they had to

302
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:47,128
weaken him in different ways with kryptonite you know so green kryptonite

303
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:51,569
kind of made him sick and red kryptonite I think kind of mutated him if I

304
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:55,288
remember correctly and anyways they had to introduce flaws into his characters

305
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:59,109
so that there could be some damn plot and that's something to think about you

306
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:05,288
know there's a deep existential lesson in that in that your being is limited

307
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:12,339
and flawed and fragile you're like the genie which is genius in the little tiny

308
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:16,459
in the little tiny lamp you know this immense potential but

309
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,919
constrained in this tiny little living space as Robin Williams said when he

310
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,220
played the genie in Aladdin but the fact that you have limitations means that the

311
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,899
plot of your life is the overcoming of those limitations and that if you didn't

312
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:35,288
have limitations well there wouldn't be a plot and maybe there would be no life

313
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:39,500
and so that's part of the reason why perhaps you have to accept the fact that

314
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,569
you're flawed and insufficient and and live with it and consider it a

315
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:49,538
precondition for being it's at least a reasonable

316
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:55,419
it's a reasonable idea so anyways one of the main characters is the country the

317
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,730
known the explored territory we went over that a bit and it always has two

318
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,569
elements I mean your country is your greatest friend and your worst enemy you

319
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:11,869
know because it squashes you into conformity and demands that you act in a

320
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:16,138
certain manner and reduces your individuality to that element that's

321
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:21,250
tolerated by everyone else and it it constrains your potential in a single

322
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:27,378
direction and so it's really tyrannical but at the same time it provides you

323
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:33,849
with a place to be and all of the benefits that have accrued as a result

324
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:38,589
of the actions of your ancestors and all the other people that you're associated

325
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:45,240
with so there's the good tyrant or the bad tyrant and the good King and those

326
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,960
are archetypal figures and that's because they're always true and they're

327
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,700
always true simultaneously you know which is partly why I object to the

328
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,840
notion of the patriarchy because it's a myth the law the it's the what do you

329
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,869
call that it's the apprehension of a mythological trope which is that of the

330
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:07,508
evil tyrant without any appreciation for the fact that the archetype actually has

331
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:12,079
two parts and the other part is the wise king and you know you can tell an evil

332
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,240
tyrant story about culture no problem but it's one-sided and that's very

333
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,210
dangerous because you don't want to forget all the good things that you have

334
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,960
while you're criticizing all the ways that things are in error that's a lack

335
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,269
of gratitude and it's a lack of wisdom and it's it's founded in resentment and

336
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:40,009
it's it's very dangerous both personally and socially I told you that Captain

337
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:44,329
Hook is a tyrant because he's got this crocodile chasing him in the crocodile

338
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,808
has a clock in its stomach and that's death it's like obviously right tick

339
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:53,249
tick tick tick and it's a crocodile and it's under the water and it's already

340
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:57,798
got a taste of him so he's being chased around by death and that makes him

341
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,569
terrified and resentful and and cruel and bitter

342
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,960
so he's a tyrant and he wants to wreak havoc everywhere and then Peter Pan of

343
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,319
course looks at Captain Hook and thinks why the hell should I grow up and to be

344
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,939
a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential of childhood and the answer to that is

345
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,390
the potential sacrifices itself if you don't utilize it as you mature and you

346
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:28,090
just end up a 40 year old lost boy which is a horrifying thing to behold it's

347
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,928
almost as if you're the corpse of a child the living corpse of a child

348
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,970
because who the hell wants a six-year-old 40 year old you're a little

349
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,850
on the stale side by that point and not the world's happiest individual so you

350
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,469
know your potential is going to disappear because you aged anyways and

351
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,269
so you might as well shape that potential in a particular direction and

352
00:29:50,269 --> 00:30:00,909
at least become something no matter how limited rather than nothing so you know

353
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:08,679
Peter Pan that's a great story it's a great mythological story so well so

354
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,519
let's talk about tyrants well not only are they mythological figures but they

355
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,990
exist and they tend to be deified I mean Stalin was for all intents and purposes

356
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,950
God the Father in Soviet Russia although he was pretty much only the worst

357
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,100
elements of Old Testament God who was you know constantly smiting people and

358
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,798
and wiping out populations and doing all sorts of things that seem to be quite

359
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:39,759
nasty but nonetheless you know people worshipped him in many ways and and he's

360
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,970
a representation of just exactly what goes wrong when things really go wrong

361
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,298
when people stop paying attention and when they all lie because one of the

362
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:52,628
things that characterized the communist state was that no one ever got to say

363
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:58,248
anything they actually believed ever and that was partly because one out of three

364
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:02,038
people was an informer which meant if you had a family of six people two of

365
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:05,339
them were informing on the government about you and that included your own

366
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,638
children and you and if you were an informer you were often amply rewarded

367
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,359
by the state so that if you lived in an overcrowded apartment building with

368
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,859
three families in the same flat and you informed on you know the

369
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:22,969
woman down the hall that you didn't like she got shift shipped off to the old

370
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,909
concentration camp and you got her apartment and so that was a lovely

371
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:32,080
society and it only killed about thirty million people between 1919 and nineteen

372
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,000
fifty-nine so that's what happens when the archetypal structure gets tilted

373
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,519
badly when people forget that they have a responsibility to fulfill as citizens

374
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,029
as awake citizens who are capable of stating the truth and the archetype

375
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:53,618
shift so there's nothing left of the Great Father except the tyrant and let's

376
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:57,878
not have that happen I mean the one on the right is really interesting because

377
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:03,618
consciously or unconsciously you know there's Stalin surrounded by what is for

378
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:09,538
all intents and purposes fire you know he looks like he looks like Maleficent

379
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,579
in Sleeping Beauty when she shows up at Aurora's christening you know she puts

380
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:22,908
her arms up in the air and green fire surrounds her it's like it's like he's

381
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:26,909
surrounded by fire and there's Lenin above him who's like king of the fiery

382
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,840
realm and that's for sure so I mean all the terrors that happened

383
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:35,220
in the Soviet Union didn't start under stell and they started under Lenin and

384
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,419
Lenin was or Stalin was definitely Lenin's legitimate son let's put it that

385
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:48,080
way so you know this is another example of the tyrannical element of the Great

386
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:55,480
Father and the sorts of things that can happen I mean I kind of got a an evil

387
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,288
kick out of this bad that was quite old you know

388
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:03,919
it's kitschy in some sense and and you know it shows I don't think that's

389
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,169
something you'd ever see at a magazine today

390
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:14,929
10 unusual stamps showing evil dictator you know well fair enough I mean that's

391
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:19,559
what he was and that's the consequence and that's just a tiny bit of the

392
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,980
consequence because the Nazis wiped out a very large number of people often

393
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:32,179
using compassion as a as a as a as a justification so when they went

394
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:39,769
after the mentally ill and the terminally ill and those who whose

395
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:44,210
intelligence was compromised for biological reasons and and those who

396
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,829
were too old they basically justified it by saying

397
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:52,699
that the enforced euthanasia was merciful and that you were actually

398
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,580
being a good person by complying with the requirements and so something to

399
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,058
think about more mythological representations I like

400
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:06,460
these quite a bit so there's their Hitler as you know Knight of the faith

401
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,829
essentially with I suppose that's a recreation of the Christian holy spirit

402
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:18,099
dove you know except it's an eagle which is a bird of prey and and a prayer and

403
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,759
uh what do you call those things a scavenger right so that's kind of

404
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,020
interesting but that's Hitler as night of the of the blood roughly speaking and

405
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:35,759
there this is an allied war poster essentially that assimilates the Nazis

406
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,260
to poisonous snakes and you know we don't like poisonous snakes very much

407
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,230
and and it's probably because they've been preying on us for approximately

408
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:51,599
twenty million years because snakes and primates humans in particular co-evolved

409
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,759
and so the snake is a representation of that which lies outside the comfortable

410
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,010
domain and that can be you know a snake obviously or it can be an abstract snake

411
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,840
and the abstract snake is your enemy or an even more abstract snake is the evil

412
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,880
in your own heart and this is going to be a bit of a leap for you but there's

413
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,849
this ancient idea that developed in what in the West over thousands of years far

414
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:29,000
predating Christianity that at least its origins that the snake in the Garden of

415
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,639
Eden was also Satan which is like of what the hell it's a very strange idea

416
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,949
but the reason for that as far as I can tell is that you know we have this

417
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:42,869
circuitry that detects predators and a predator

418
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,509
representation of a predator is a snake or a monster that incorporates

419
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,920
snake-like features like a dragon or something like that or a dinosaur with

420
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,700
lots of teeth or a shark that lives under the water and will pull you down

421
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:58,299
you know because I suspect a lot of our ancestors met a nasty death at the hands

422
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,000
of Nile crocodiles while they were in the African veldt going down to get some

423
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,389
nice water so you know that's the thing that jumps up and pulls you under and

424
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:11,129
you know that happens in your own life because things jump up and pull you

425
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,640
under you know and use the same circuitry we use the same circuitry to

426
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:21,789
process unknown things that upset us as we once used to detect predators who

427
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:27,210
were likely to invade our space and so and and human beings are capable of

428
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,929
abstraction and so you know you could think about the real predator that might

429
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:35,239
invade your space and maybe that's a snake or a wolf or or some kind of

430
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,500
monster you know and that's pretty concrete and biological chimps have that

431
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,190
you know chimps don't like snakes and so if you a chimp comes across a snake in

432
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,309
the wild then like a big let's say I don't know what live with chimps I don't

433
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:54,070
know if they're pythons but they have constrictors there anyways so you know

434
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,630
maybe there's like a 20 foot constrictor and this and the chimp like stays a good

435
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,900
distance away from it but it won't leave and then it has this particular cry that

436
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:09,910
it uh ters that's called a snake rah WRA a and so it makes this noise which means

437
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:14,940
something like holy shit that's a big snake and I actually mean that because

438
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,950
the circuits that primates use to utter distress calls are the same circuits

439
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:25,359
that we use to curse just so you know that's why people with Tourette's

440
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,329
syndrome swear because like what what's up with that how can you have a

441
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:34,219
neurological condition that makes you swear well it turns out that guttural

442
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:40,559
effect Laden curses are mediated by a different speech circuit and that's the

443
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,829
speech circuit we share with the predator alarms of other primates so

444
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,559
that's pretty cool so anyways this chimp stands there and makes this snake noise

445
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,190
and then all bunch of other chimps come running and you know some of them stay a

446
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,589
fair ways from the snake can some of them get pretty close but

447
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,700
they'll stand there and watch that snake for like 24 hours you know so they're

448
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:06,849
fascinated by it and you know if you've handled snakes you can understand that

449
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:12,940
fascination because they're fascinating you know and they're numinous I would

450
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,019
say that that's the right way of putting it at numinous is a word that means

451
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:22,300
intrinsically meaningful like a fire you know you can't look away from fire you

452
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,289
know if you're sitting in front of a fireplace it's like you're staring at it

453
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:30,050
and that's because you're all descended from the first mad chimpanzee who had

454
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:35,880
some weird genetic mutation that made it impossible for him to stay away from

455
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,559
fire it was like the first chimp arsonist you know and and he figured it

456
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,539
out and well hey now he was a chimp with a stick with fire on it like that's a

457
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:53,840
mega chimp man and so you know we have that mutation in spades and no wonder so

458
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:01,970
anyways so they they make this you know they have this reaction to snakes and

459
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,409
chimps that have never seen a snake if they're in a cage and you throw a rubber

460
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:10,109
snake in there it's like bang they hit the roof but then they look at the snake

461
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,099
you know it's so it's like it's terrifying and fascinating at the same

462
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,440
time and you should look at the snake because you want to know what it does

463
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,909
but you should stay away from it because it's a snake so you you're kind of

464
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:25,429
screwed in terms of your motivations right one is get the hell away and the

465
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:30,589
other is well don't don't let that thing do anything that you're not watching and

466
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:36,380
so that's really the reaction we have to the unknown it's terrifying but we watch

467
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,070
it and then you know the meta story is that not only do we watch it but we go

468
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,510
explore it and so you might think well back in the Garden of Eden so to speak

469
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:51,440
when we were living in trees the snakes used to come and eat us and and our

470
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,349
offspring more likely and you know we weren't very happy about that and then

471
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,670
we figured out how to maybe maybe by accident draw up a stay a stick on a

472
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,909
snake and that was a good thing because the snake didn't like that and then

473
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:09,429
maybe the next thing we learned a little later was to like actually take a stick

474
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:11,929
and like ock the snake with it and you can

475
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:16,969
believe that the first primate who figured out that was just as popular as

476
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:21,269
the guy who mastered fire and so we're pretty good at whacking state snakes

477
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:25,989
with sticks which is why Springfield has a snake

478
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:30,520
whacking day it's devoted to nothing but that right I don't know if you know that

479
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:35,870
Simpsons episode but it's quite comical so well so then you think about the

480
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,730
snake as a predator and it's the thing that invades the garden always because

481
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,940
you just can't keep snakes out of the damn garden no matter how hard you try

482
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,510
and then you think of snakes and maybe you think of meta snakes and like a meta

483
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:54,980
snake would be also a predator but maybe that's the predator that represents the

484
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,250
the destructive spirit of the other tribe because chimpanzees for example

485
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,869
are quite tribal and they definitely go to war with one another and so you think

486
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,089
you abstract out the idea of the predator to represent malevolence as

487
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:14,600
such and then you take that one step further and you realize that the worst

488
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:22,679
of all evil predators is the human capacity for evil and then at that point

489
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,389
you know you're starting to I would say psychologize or spiritual eyes the idea

490
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:33,119
of danger and making it make it into something that's conceptual and

491
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,099
something that's psychological and something that you can you can face sort

492
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,989
of on mas I mean one of the things people had to figure out was how do you

493
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:47,149
deal with danger and so you feel figure out how you deal with a specific danger

494
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,099
but then because human beings are death so damn smart they thought well what if

495
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:56,880
we considered the class of all dangerous things and then what have we considered

496
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
a a mode of being that was the best mode of being in the face of the class of all

497
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,139
dangerous things well that's a lot better you get you know you could solve

498
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:10,309
all the dangerous problems all at once instead of having to conjure up a

499
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:14,280
different solution for every dangerous thing and that's basically as far as I

500
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,110
can tell where the hero's story came from and the hero's story is basically

501
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:23,610
you know there's a community it's threatened by the emergence of some old

502
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,620
evil often represented by a dragon that's

503
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:32,769
sort of typical say of the Lord of the Rings stories there's a hero often a

504
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:37,009
humble guy but not always sometimes a knight decides he'll go out there you

505
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:42,040
know and chase down the snake maybe even or the serpent or the dragon maybe even

506
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:46,190
in its lair and he'll have a bunch of adventures on the way that transform him

507
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:53,929
from you know useless naive Hobbit into you know sword wielding hero and he

508
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:57,509
confronts the dragon and gets the gold and frees the people that it had

509
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,750
enslaved and then comes back transformed to share what he's learned with the

510
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,670
community it's like well that's the human story fundamentally and that's

511
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,950
that's our basic instinctive pattern and it's represented in narratives

512
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:15,619
constantly and that's partly what this see this has meaning you know what this

513
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:20,059
means why why do you know well you know

514
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:23,130
because it draws on symbolic representations that you already

515
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:29,849
understand you understand that a mess of tooth snakes is not a good thing and

516
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:37,269
that may be the sensible thing to do is stomp them and it's not like you need an

517
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:42,030
instruction manual to figure out what the poster means and so you know that's

518
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,300
two different representations of Hitler that's sort of the pro-hitler

519
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,820
representation and I would say that's the anti-hitler representation and you

520
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,100
know that's the real Hitler who at this point does not look like a very happy

521
00:43:53,099 --> 00:44:00,079
clam so so that's the known that's culture that's order and what's

522
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,819
eternally juxtaposed to culture and the known and the explored and order is the

523
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:13,019
unknown and the unknown is a strange place the unknown is actually it's a

524
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:17,559
physical place like the unknown is the place that when you're camping and

525
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,059
you're around a fire the unknown is everything outside the circle of the

526
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:28,469
light and you remember in the Lion King you may not remember when when when

527
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:34,230
Mufasa that's the king right goes and takes Simba up to show him his territory

528
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,679
he says he is the king of everything that the light touches

529
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,639
and that's a very old idea and you guys had no problem with you know that was

530
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,429
fine that made sense and that I would be on the light was the darkness and that

531
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:50,409
was the elephant graveyard that was death that was the place of death and

532
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:54,289
danger that's where the hyenas hung out and you weren't supposed to go there and

533
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:58,059
so of course Simba because he's a rule breaking hero just like Harry Potter

534
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:02,889
immediately goes there and so you know that's like the forbidden fruit it's the

535
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:08,960
same sort of idea if you want someone to do something the best thing to do is

536
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,230
tell them that they shouldn't and not explain why you know so for example if I

537
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:20,469
said to you at the beginning of this class look I've got one rule here don't

538
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:25,539
sit in that chair no matter what you'd be thinking the whole year especially if

539
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:29,980
I reminded you well just what's up with that chair like let's chair as magical

540
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,440
all of a sudden you some of you might even well you probably wouldn't because

541
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,389
this is a ridiculous example but maybe you know you come to class early and sit

542
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:41,099
in that chair just to see what would happen you know and people are very

543
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,190
curious and that's exactly what we're like and that's a very old story too

544
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,510
right it's like opening Pandora's box don't open that box you'll be sorry it's

545
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:55,130
like oh huh you know all the horrors of the world fly out and believe me you

546
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:00,349
will open Pandora's box many times in your life because you know with your

547
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:06,380
family or maybe your mate or maybe your children you'll have this idea that they

548
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,059
have a box with things in it that you want to know about and you'll say well

549
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,130
I'm kind of curious about this particular event so why don't you tell

550
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,099
me about it and they say well no we probably really shouldn't open that box

551
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:23,150
and you keep bugging them and then they open it and then all sorts of things fly

552
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,510
out that you didn't expect and then maybe you think hey it would have been

553
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:31,000
better if I would have just left that damn box closed but and you can do the

554
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,550
same thing to yourself believe me and so the Pandora's box idea the

555
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,420
forbidden fruit idea that's that's a major-league idea and part of the reason

556
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,289
in the judeo-christian tradition why people are saddled with the notion of

557
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:51,340
original sin is because hyper cortically developed chimpanzees without much sense

558
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,010
can keep their hands off things and so they

559
00:46:55,010 --> 00:47:00,490
keep exploring even when they know better and every time they do that they

560
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:07,789
learn something that is that destroys the paradise that they currently inhabit

561
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,309
right because there's plenty Unni and I never learned anything in your life

562
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:16,889
that's of importance without it having a pretty damn destabilizing effect on you

563
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:23,089
at the moment of realisation right you learn something happy it's like whatever

564
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,370
you know that all that means is that I was doing things right like it's nice

565
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:32,609
and everything but it's not informative you do something and all hell breaks

566
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:38,269
loose that'll make you think that's for sure you might never stop thinking for

567
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:44,840
the rest of your life so anyways the unknown the unknown is that which

568
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,780
surrounds the known it's an unexplored territory it's usually represented as

569
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,870
female I think for a variety of reasons and not not as female exactly it's not

570
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:58,090
the right way to think about it as feminine and that's not the same thing

571
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:03,849
because feminine is a symbolic category whereas female is like an actual female

572
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:08,630
and so you don't want to confuse the metaphor with with the with the

573
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:14,349
actuality because we have these social cognitive categories built-in you know

574
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:19,170
you might say masculine feminine and offspring something like that we had to

575
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,680
use what we could to represent what we were attempting to figure out and we

576
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:30,359
kind of mapped them onto the external realities of being the best we could

577
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,800
using what we could and so you know nature is benevolent and it's fruitful

578
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,500
you know all things come from nature and all things come from the unknown right

579
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,300
because the known is already there it's the unknown that manifests the new right

580
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,050
and so that's part of the reason for the characterization of the unknown as

581
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:57,070
feminine and then there's also the case that women play a massive role in sexual

582
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:02,900
selection among human beings so that mmm from an evolutionary perspective you're

583
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,331
twice as likely to be a failure if you're a man then you

584
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:11,039
or if you're a woman in that you have twice as many female ancestors as male

585
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,389
ancestors and you think well that's impossible but it's not all you have to

586
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:20,219
do is imagine that every woman has one child half the men have two and the

587
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:25,899
other half have zero and so end of problem and that's basically how it

588
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:31,380
works out so women are more choosy mater's than men by a substantial margin

589
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,300
there was a funny study done by the guy who established it's one of the big

590
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:46,769
dating sites and he looked at how women rated men and they rated the 50th

591
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:52,429
percentile man at the 15th percentile so 85% of men were below average according

592
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:57,429
to women's ratings now men had their same arbitrary choices because of course

593
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:02,799
they preferred younger women to older women and and they were more swayed I

594
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,880
would say by by attractiveness but that didn't have set nearly as big an effect

595
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:15,061
on their actually actually writing of women so anyway so you know from from a

596
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:22,410
Darwinian perspective nature is that which selects so that's all it is and so

597
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:27,069
sexual selection plays a massive role in human evolution you know the fact that

598
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,080
we have these massive brains is very likely a consequence of a positive

599
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:35,319
feedback loop and sexual selection you know because otherwise that's the

600
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,320
only time you can get really rapid changes in evolutionary space where you

601
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,890
know you get a process going that reinforces itself so there's a little

602
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:48,799
preference for intelligence and then that produces more intelligent men and

603
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,240
women and then there's a little more preference for intelligence and you know

604
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,889
maybe then that turns into the ability to speak and or to master fire and then

605
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:00,940
there's way more selection for intelligence and the brain just goes

606
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,179
like this you know and women have paid a pretty big price for that because your

607
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:10,859
hips are basically so wide that you can barely run and if they were any wider

608
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:16,480
than you couldn't and of course the pelvic passageway through which the baby

609
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,809
travels is too small so it's really painful and dangerous and the

610
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:26,349
baby's head has to compress quite a lot I mean they come out cone-shaped often

611
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:30,699
and then they're born really young so you have to take care of them forever

612
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,000
like what the hell you know a deer is born a fawn is born and it's like two

613
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,289
seconds later it's standing and then it's running from a lion it's like you

614
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:44,980
know it's like 15 minutes later and a baby it's like you just lies there and

615
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,829
you know utters plaintive noises that's all it can do and that does that for

616
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:56,219
like ten months before it could skitter away from a sloth if it was predatory

617
00:51:56,219 --> 00:52:01,439
you know so you really got to take care of those creatures and so that's a big

618
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,440
price to pay that's a big price to pay for our cortical evolution so anyways

619
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,559
here is some of the symbolic represents representatives of the unknown the

620
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,489
unconscious Dionysian force of the it'd that sort of Freud's representation of

621
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:23,129
the unknown the terrors of the darkness that's the unknown the monsters that

622
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:28,510
lurk they're the source and the resting place of all things the great mother the

623
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,020
Queen the matrix which means matter which means mother

624
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:37,320
the matriarch matter mother the container the cornucopia the object to

625
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,240
be fertilized the source of all things the fecund

626
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:46,869
the pregnant the strange the emotional the foreigner the place of return and

627
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:51,940
rest the deep the valley the cleft the cave hell death and the grave because

628
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:57,570
it's beyond the moon ruler of the night and mysterious dark and matter and the

629
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:03,140
earth then you know all this because when you watch a movie that's rife with

630
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:07,480
symbolic representations it draws on those underlying metaphors and they're

631
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,719
natural I mean where does a witch live well in a swamp for God's sake she

632
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,059
doesn't live in the penthouse of a New York Tower she lives in a swamp and it's

633
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:20,090
dark there and if the moon's up that's a better and maybe it could be a crescent

634
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,970
moon or maybe it could be a full moon but you know witches live in the right

635
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:28,189
place if you're going to understand it and you all you understand all of that

636
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:33,429
and it's part of the structure of your imagination you could say

637
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:40,509
and so it's part of the unspoken fantastical imagination that unites all

638
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:45,940
of us and it makes us specifically human there's a good representation of the

639
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,880
underworld and the place of transformation so that's Hell in Isis in

640
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,990
Egypt was queen of the underworld and the underworld generally has a queen and

641
00:53:54,989 --> 00:54:01,159
she usually shows up when order falls apart and so you go to the underworld

642
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:05,239
when your life falls apart that's what it means and so when you see these

643
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:13,579
stories of the hero you know journeying to unknown lands of terror and danger

644
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:16,889
that's that's what happens to you it happens to you all the time you know

645
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:22,519
you're you're in this little safe space like The Hobbit in the Shire and then

646
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:26,400
you know there's a great evil brewing somewhere and you can no longer ignore

647
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,750
it so off you go into the land of terror and uncertainty and better to go on

648
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,809
purpose then accidentally that's for sure because at least you can be

649
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:41,309
prepared and we also know that if you're going to face a threat if you face it

650
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:45,699
voluntarily what happens is your body activates itself for exploration and

651
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:52,159
mastery but if you face it involuntarily same size threat then you you you you

652
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,940
revert to pray pray mode and you're frozen and that's way way way more

653
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,690
stressful it's way harder on your body and so it's better to keep your eye open

654
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,190
and watch for emergent threats because you all know you know what you're not

655
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,929
doing quite right and where your life is likely to unravel you all have a sense

656
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:16,119
of that and the best thing to do is to not ignore that to pay attention to it

657
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:21,880
to watch it and to take corrective action early and then you know you stay

658
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,039
on top of things and things your little trip to the underworld might be a few

659
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:30,119
minutes long instead of a catastrophe that produces post-traumatic stress

660
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,819
disorder knocks you out for four or five years and maybe you never recover so and

661
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,019
that's right you know that's what these kind of symbolic representations mean

662
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:46,130
it's those are states of being that that that indicate being devoured and you can

663
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,050
be devoured your own unconscious Jesus that happens

664
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:54,180
all the time what does that mean well you know and it's an autonomous thing in

665
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:57,679
some sense you know like if you if you get depressed or if you get really

666
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,649
anxious you don't have any control over that it's like it sweeps up over you and

667
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:08,670
pulls you down why down well down is where you go when you're sad you don't

668
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:14,480
go up man I'm up today oh that's too bad no it's man I'm down today and well

669
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,889
that's partly this and it's partly because this is subordinate and it's

670
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:24,730
partly because down is closer to the ground and farther from the sky like

671
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,539
there's all sorts of reasons you're feeling down rather than up up is where

672
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:34,730
you're aiming right yeh MUP you don't aim down well there the reason those

673
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,630
phrases make sense is because they're locked deeply into this underlying

674
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:44,019
structure of imagination and well those are the architect or the archetypal

675
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:52,530
structures according to Jung and I I think that he's far as I can tell he's

676
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:58,300
dead accurate and I think we understand the biology of such things much better

677
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,420
than we did so there is more representations she's she's quite the

678
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,490
friendly creature that's Kelly I like this representation better those

679
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:12,589
are heads by the way in hands so she sort of represents well very complex

680
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:17,730
things she represents death she represents transformation in this I

681
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,909
already like this representation I think it's brilliant so imagine that what the

682
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,039
people were doing who formulated these representations what they were trying to

683
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:32,000
do was to make a representation of the domain of threat itself right so that

684
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,829
they could deal with the idea that because we can say threat well what is

685
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:39,590
that what the hell does that mean well threat is the category of all

686
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,980
threatening things and so then you can think about threat and you can think

687
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,510
about threat across all those individual instances and maybe you can figure out

688
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:53,100
how to deal with threat right how what's the best way to be in the world so that

689
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,029
you most effectively deal with threat well that's sort of like apart from how

690
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,700
do you deal with pain that's sort of like the ultimate

691
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:05,299
question of human beings you want to be terrified No

692
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,130
so you want to be in danger No so like you better figure out how to deal with

693
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,369
threat so first of all you have to conceptualize it so we'll take a look at

694
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:16,929
this representation so that's Kelly shear

695
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:22,269
her hair is on fire well fire you know that's that's a numinous phenomena

696
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:28,440
dangerous but transformative she's wearing a headdress of skulls she has a

697
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,289
weapon in this hand and and she has a tiger's tongue she often has a snake

698
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:39,110
around her waist need none of these do but she often does but in this case this

699
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:44,010
then that's because you know it it's a snake we've already covered that well

700
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:47,430
these things that look like snakes here aren't you notice how her belly is

701
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:52,009
concave well it's because she's just given birth to this unfortunate person

702
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,950
that she happens to be standing on and she's eating him intestines first and

703
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:01,019
that's a fire ring which he is in and then it's got skulls on the inside of it

704
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:05,820
it's like what's that supposed to do well partly it's supposed to represent

705
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:11,170
that which terrifies you it's like yeah fair enough man because I don't imagine

706
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,409
you saw those things in there before I explained them but someone who was

707
00:59:14,409 --> 00:59:18,769
familiar with that image would know what it meant it's like some poor artist was

708
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:22,530
sitting there thinking well how do I represent destruction it's like bang

709
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:27,410
whoa okay well put that down and then we won't look at it again so and then what

710
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:33,219
do you do with this you make sacrifices to it and you think well that's kind of

711
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:40,719
primitive you know first of all well that doesn't really exist well it does

712
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,819
if it's an amalgam of threat symbols I can tell you that it exists that's for

713
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:51,500
sure so it exists as an abstraction if nothing else do you offer it sacrifices

714
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,510
well what the hell do you think you do what are you doing in class why aren't

715
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:59,810
you like drinking vodka and snorting cocaine you know because you could be

716
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:06,009
doing that instead here you are listening to me you know slaving away in

717
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:10,630
university you're young it's like really you've got nothing better to do than sit

718
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:15,329
there you know well what you're willing to forego today

719
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:20,179
pleasure for tomorrow's advantage and that's what sacrifice is and human

720
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:25,259
beings discovered that dramatically first you know like we were we were apes

721
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:29,890
for God's sake we didn't just leap up and think oh we better save for tomorrow

722
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:34,859
you know we it took thousands of years for that idea to emerge and it emerged

723
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:40,000
in dramatic form and it was sort of like well society is sort of like a god know

724
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,650
what they weren't thinking this through is like if you're gonna represent

725
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:47,910
society well it's like this masculine God that's always judging the

726
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:51,869
hell out of you that's everywhere all at the same time it's like yeah yeah that's

727
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:55,619
true absolutely and what do you have to do with it well you have to give it what

728
01:00:55,619 --> 01:01:01,690
it wants why why do you have to give it what it wants because it'll crush you if

729
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:06,519
you don't and that's exactly right and if you're lucky and you give it the

730
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:12,090
right sacrifice then it'll smile on you and you get to have a good life and that

731
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:17,960
was like that was the major discovery of mankind man that was a killer discovery

732
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,619
it was like the discovery of the future you know we discovered the future as a

733
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:29,019
place and it was a place that you could bargain with you can bargain with the

734
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:34,800
future wow that's just what an idea that is you know it's it's so unlikely well

735
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:40,840
how do you bargain with the future well you give it what it wants and you know

736
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,410
some of that you maintain your social relationship and you know you make

737
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:49,509
yourself useful to other people and you shape yourself so that you can cooperate

738
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:55,030
with people and you you don't act impulsively and maybe you squirrel

739
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:59,210
something away for the next harvest even if you're hungry and you know and then

740
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:04,679
the future isn't hell and you make the proper sacrifices and so if you

741
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:11,799
sacrifice to Kelly then she turns into her opposite and showers benevolence on

742
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:17,690
you and that's Mother Nature right it's like look out for Mother Nature man you

743
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:22,110
know two weeks out in the bush right now and you're dead and it's not pleasant

744
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:27,150
and then if it's the spring you last longer huh but the bugs eat you and so

745
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:32,260
that's not very fun either so nature you know it's bent on your

746
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:37,000
destruction but if you treat it properly and carefully and make the right

747
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,929
sacrifices then maybe one of her trees will offer you some fruit and that would

748
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:48,739
be okay and so believe me lots of people died trying to figure that out

749
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:53,409
so here's another way of looking at it so I said you know order and chaos known

750
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:58,359
unknown explored territory unexplored territory I love this this is the Taoist

751
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:04,180
symbol it's a symbol of being and being isn't reality as you would conceptualize

752
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:09,869
it as a scientist it's more like reality as it manifests itself to you as a

753
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,759
living thing which is completely different you know science extracts out

754
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,180
all the subjectivity all it is there is an array of our objective facts of

755
01:03:19,179 --> 01:03:22,969
equivalent value and that's part of its method but that's not the world in which

756
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:27,799
you live the world in which you live is full of motivation and emotion it's full

757
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:33,050
of terror and pain and joy and frustration and and other people that's

758
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:38,289
for sure and so that's the real world and so well that's what this is it's

759
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:42,400
it's the real world and what is it made out of well it's made out of all those

760
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:49,059
things you know that can get out of hand you know because the explored territory

761
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:53,659
and the known can get so damn tight that it's nothing but a tyrant and then it's

762
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:56,960
all those things you don't know and that's pretty exciting because you know

763
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,119
you want to go find out some things you don't know and that adds a lot of spice

764
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,369
to life you want a little adventure you don't want to go out with someone who's

765
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:08,029
so predictable that you know everything about them in a week you know unless

766
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,560
you're hyper conservative you want to go out with someone who's got they're a

767
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,639
little erratic like not too erratic let's say they're a little dangerous

768
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:21,429
perhaps not too dangerous but some of that at least you want predictability

769
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:25,579
with a bit of unpredictability in there well that's exactly what this means it's

770
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:29,869
like that's predictability with a little unpredictability in it and what that

771
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:34,130
also means is that what you know can be turned into what you don't know just

772
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:38,650
like that and that's going to happen to you lots of times in your life man when

773
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,660
someone close to you dies suddenly it's like poof

774
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:46,519
order turns into chaos and now you're in chaos and what the hell are you gonna do

775
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:51,079
there and that's a good question because you need to know what to do

776
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,389
there cuz you're gonna be there and it happens to you when your dreams fall

777
01:04:55,389 --> 01:04:59,379
apart you know I mean your dreams for your life or you know when you discover

778
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:03,800
something awful about yourself that you didn't know or you know it flips on you

779
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,410
all the time and in small ways sometimes you know you have a fight with a friend

780
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:13,609
or in big ways that that wipe you out for well indefinitely sometimes because

781
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:18,320
you can fall into chaos and never get out you know that's the people who are

782
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,370
trapped in the belly of the beast it isn't necessary that when you descend

783
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:26,880
into chaos that you learn something and you get back out you could just be stuck

784
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,220
there suffering until you die and that's you know I wouldn't recommend that you

785
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:37,139
know it's something to avoid but it happens to people all the time all the

786
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:42,639
time you see them wandering around you know shattered on the streets of Toronto

787
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:47,789
you know they're done they're in chaos and there's so much chaos around them

788
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:52,170
that you won't even go near them the chaos spreads like eight feet around

789
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:55,659
them and so when you see someone like that you're like well first we're not

790
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:59,389
going to look too closely and people like that often don't like you to look

791
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:03,379
at them because that also helps them remember where they are and that's no

792
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,500
Pleasant thing and you're gonna just stay away from that maybe you'll cross

793
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,670
the street maybe you'll keep your head down whatever you're not going anywhere

794
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:16,940
near that chaos and no bloody wonder you know and and you don't think about it

795
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:22,190
much after you pass it because it's a hell of a thing to think about and what

796
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,579
are you gonna do about it anyway so you don't know what to do about it you might

797
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:32,130
just make it worse well so chaos you know that's the other half of life and

798
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:36,140
it can turn into order sometimes better order that's actually what you do when

799
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:40,600
you explore right you explore you find out something new not too new not to

800
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:47,619
Pandora boxy you know you bite off as much as you can chew but no more and so

801
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:51,369
that rearranges the way you look at the world but you're doing it voluntarily so

802
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:55,980
you can kind of tolerate there the recalibration and you strength

803
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,789
and the order right because now you become more competent and I would say

804
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:05,949
that you're trying to live on the edge between order and chaos and I and I mean

805
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:10,029
that's a real place that's an actual it's a meta place but it's more real

806
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:15,310
than places because it's so old it's such an old place it really exists and

807
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:19,440
your nervous system knows that it sees the world this way in fact the right

808
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,950
hemisphere is roughly specialized for chaos and the left hemisphere is roughly

809
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:27,509
specialized for order which is why the left hemisphere tends to have the

810
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,460
linguistic elements and and why people are right-handed and the right

811
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,199
hemisphere has a more diffuse structure it's more associated with negative

812
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,139
emotion and imagination and the two communicate between each other through

813
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,889
the corpus callosum and the right hemisphere appears to update the less

814
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:49,059
left hemisphere kind of slowly often in dreams and so if you were hurt if your

815
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:53,750
right hemisphere is hurt for example back here in the parietal lobe then you

816
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:58,230
lose the left part of your body you can't move it anymore

817
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:02,690
but you also lose the idea that you have a left part of your body so it's like

818
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:07,200
blindness it's a blindness to the left and so if someone comes along and says

819
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,799
you know you're not moving your left arm you're gonna say yeah well my arthritis

820
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,199
is bothering me 2d have moved it for six months MA my arthritis is bothering

821
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:22,358
today or you know you don't move in your left foot it's like well you know uh I'm

822
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:26,910
too tired well what's happened is the left hemisphere has a representation of

823
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:30,579
the body and it's not being updated because the part of the brain that would

824
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:35,750
notice that the left is gone because of a stroke it isn't there anymore and so

825
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:40,369
the left already has a model and it's not gonna change just it's hard to

826
01:08:40,369 --> 01:08:44,649
change your model of yourself you know have a tooth pulled what happens it's

827
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:49,159
like your damn tongue is in that hole for the next six months fiddling around

828
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:53,519
constantly and that's because you're rebuilding your neurological model of

829
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,690
your body it's like try it out with your whole left side and see how well you do

830
01:08:58,689 --> 01:09:03,289
you know so this guy named Ramachandran was experimenting with people like this

831
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:07,710
and one of the things he did was kind of he was checking their balance and you

832
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:12,460
can do that by irrigating the ear with cold water and

833
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,350
that makes people go like this makes their eyes move back and forth because

834
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:20,250
it upsets the vestibular system and what he found was that if he if he poured

835
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:24,609
cold water in the left ear of someone with right per aisle damage who had left

836
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:30,000
neglect that they'd all of a sudden sort of wake up catastrophic ly they'd have a

837
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,920
terrible reaction to the fact that they were paralyzed on the left and they

838
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,190
would know that it had happened and cry and you know amid all sorts of distress

839
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:44,460
and no wonder and then like 20 minutes later they'd

840
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:52,430
snap back into their damaged mode of being and they would not deny because

841
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,650
that isn't really what it is is that they couldn't update the model they just

842
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:00,059
didn't have the neurology for it anymore so they were back to not noticing that

843
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:05,980
it was gone and coming up with stories about it and so well so that's a good

844
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:08,979
example of how the right and left hemispheres worked together and how

845
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:13,579
they're kind of mapped onto this weirdly enough so you know we're map were

846
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:19,269
adapted to the meta reality and so what that would be is we're adapted to that

847
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:25,190
which remains constant across the longest spans of time and that's not the

848
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:30,359
same things that you see flitting around you day to day those are just they just

849
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,769
like clouds they're just evaporating you know there's things underneath that that

850
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,770
are more fundamental that are more fundamental realities like the dominance

851
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:44,380
hierarchy like the tribe like the danger outside of society like the threat that

852
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,920
other people pose to you and that you pose to yourself

853
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,119
those are eternal realities and we're adapted to those that's our world and

854
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,189
that's why we express that in stories and so then you might say well how do

855
01:10:57,189 --> 01:11:01,100
you adapt yourself to this world and the answer to that isn't I believe this is a

856
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:08,899
neurological answer I believe this that your brain can tell you when you're

857
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:13,120
optimally situated between chaos and order and the way it tells you that is

858
01:11:13,121 --> 01:11:20,220
by producing the sense of engagement and meaning so let's say there's a place in

859
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,079
the environment you should be okay what should that place be

860
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,729
well you don't want to be terrified out of your skull like what good is that and

861
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:33,029
you know you don't want to be so comfortable that you might as well sleep

862
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:38,359
you want to be somewhere where you know you're kind of on firm ground here but

863
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:43,449
over here you're kind of testing out new territory and some of you who are

864
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:47,819
exploratory and emotionally stable you know you're gonna go pretty far out into

865
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,859
the unexplored territory without destabilizing yourself and other people

866
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:57,659
are gonna just put a toe in the chaos and you know that's neuroticism

867
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:01,269
basically that's that your sensitivity to threat that's calibrated differently

868
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:05,070
in different people and more some people are more exploratory than others that's

869
01:12:05,069 --> 01:12:09,579
kind of extraversion and openness working together and and intelligence so

870
01:12:09,579 --> 01:12:15,279
some people are going to tolerate a larger admixture of chaos in their order

871
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:20,819
those are liberals by the way and I mean that technically liberals are more

872
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:26,319
interested in novel chaos and conservatives are more interested in the

873
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:32,789
stabilization of the structures that already exist and who's right well it

874
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:35,989
depends on the situation and that's why conservatives and liberals have to talk

875
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:42,039
to each other because one of them isn't right and the other wrong sometimes the

876
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:45,460
conservatives are right and sometimes the liberals are right because the

877
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,380
environments go in like this you can't predict the damn thing so that's why you

878
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,440
have to communicate and that's what a democracy does it allows people of

879
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,739
different temperamental types to communicate and to calibrate the damn

880
01:12:57,739 --> 01:13:02,859
societies so anyways so let's say you're optimally balanced between chaos and

881
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:09,019
order so what does that mean well you're stable enough but you're interested

882
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,770
right because a little novelty heightens your anxiety that wakes you up a bit

883
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,440
that's the adventure part of it but it also focuses the part of your brain that

884
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:22,649
does exploratory activity and that's actually associated with pleasure

885
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:27,719
that's the dopamine circuit and so if you're optimally balanced and you know

886
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,820
that you know you're there when you're listening to an interesting conversation

887
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:35,049
or you're engaged in one it's a real conversation you know you're saying some

888
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,570
things you know and the other person is saying some things they know

889
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:43,479
but the both of what you know is changing it's like wow that's so

890
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:46,389
interesting you'll have a conversation like that forever or maybe you're

891
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:50,070
reading a book like that or you're listening to a piece of music that

892
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:56,289
models that because what music does is provide you with predictable forms

893
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:59,670
multi-level predictable forms that transform

894
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:03,980
just the right amount and so music is a very representational art form it says

895
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:08,469
this is what the universe is like you know there's a dancing element to it

896
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:13,250
repetitive and then cute little variations that sort of surprise and

897
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:18,270
delight you and and you think wow that's so cool and it doesn't matter how

898
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:23,700
nihilistic you are you know music still infuses you with a sense of meaning and

899
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:27,939
that's because it models meaning that's what it does that's why we love it and

900
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:31,949
you know you can dance to it and that sort of symbolizes you putting yourself

901
01:14:31,949 --> 01:14:37,929
in harmony with these multiple layers of reality and positioning yourself

902
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:42,740
properly and you like that too you know you'll pay for it oh boy I get to go

903
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:46,329
dancing you know oh boy I get to listen to music it's like what the hell are you

904
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:50,960
doing listening to music what good is that well you think that's a stupid

905
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,060
question I don't care about your dopey criticism I'm going to listen to some

906
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,870
music right it did there's no rational there's no rational argument against

907
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:04,899
music it's like you just don't even think about it you just walk away from

908
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:10,379
someone who's stupid enough to ask that question it's like some things are

909
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:19,980
obvious well why okay so that's pretty fun so

910
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:24,229
what mediates between these two domains well that's what consciousness does far

911
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:28,169
as I can tell and that's sort of the individual and that's the hero that's

912
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:32,340
another way of thinking about it it's the logos that's another way of thinking

913
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:37,569
about it it's the word that generates order out of chaos at the beginning of

914
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:42,750
time it's the consciousness that interacting with the matter of the world

915
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:47,210
produces being that's basically it that's basically you for all intents and

916
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:52,960
purposes how do you do that well the unconscious

917
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,850
does it to some degree you know because it's with our fantasy that we first meet

918
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:02,620
the unknown right well look say you're going out with a new person it's like

919
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:06,849
what do you do you project a fantasy on them and then you fall in love with the

920
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:11,690
fantasy and aren't you stupid because you're gonna find out that the match

921
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:17,289
between your damn fantasy and the actual person is tenuous at best and so young

922
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:23,899
would call that a projection of either the anima or the animus you know the

923
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:27,059
anima is what a man projects onto a woman he finds desirable it's like oh

924
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,520
she's the perfect woman it's like well how do you know that

925
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,550
you've like seen her for four seconds you know but it grips you and the same

926
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:39,000
thing happens in the opposite direction and it's an action of instinct you know

927
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,789
it's like you fall in love with the image and but interestingly enough what

928
01:16:42,789 --> 01:16:47,750
you do in a relationship that works is that you actually I think that what you

929
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,770
see it's a rough approximation when you

930
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:56,649
project the ideal and fall in love with it you see what could be it could be

931
01:16:56,649 --> 01:17:00,979
that but it's going to take you a hell of a lot of work because like you got no

932
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:05,500
shortage of flaws and the other person has no shortage of flaws and so you're

933
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,979
bringing your flaws together and that's going to produce a lot of friction and

934
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:14,959
you're gonna have to engage in a lot of dialogue before you approach that level

935
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:21,590
of perfection again but maybe you can do it then you get to live happily ever

936
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:25,400
after well would not be nice well so the

937
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:29,729
unconscious meets the unknown and it it meets it with imagination and fantasy

938
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:35,779
and dream and art that's how you take so you don't just go from what you don't

939
01:17:35,779 --> 01:17:40,729
know to fully articulated knowledge in one bloody leap you can't do that you

940
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:46,399
have to extend pseudo pods of fantasy and imagination into the unknown that's

941
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,229
kind of what theorizing is like right even scientifically you know you don't

942
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:53,279
know something scientifically you generate a theory well it's an

943
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,590
imaginative representation that your unconscious is helping you generate and

944
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:02,460
so you meet the unknown with fantasy that's what the unconscious is for from

945
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,869
the psychoanalytic perspective that's what

946
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:09,960
rheems do and you can see why you dream about the future you know it's like well

947
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,159
what's the future gonna be like well you have a little imaginative story going on

948
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:17,659
and it's like you don't really create it it's sort of you watch it unfold you

949
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:21,720
know maybe you could tweak it here and there but it sort of comes to you from

950
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,740
wherever the hell things like that come from you know the unconscious that's the

951
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:31,389
psychoanalytic answer it's not really much of an answer because it's more like

952
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:36,789
a representation of a place that we don't understand but that's where

953
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:41,000
creativity comes from and I mean some people are really creative right down to

954
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,020
the bloody core so in my clinical practice I often see people who are high

955
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:49,140
in openness because they're attracted to me because they watch my lectures and

956
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,360
you have to kind of be high in openness to like my lectures so because well you

957
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:56,489
do because they go everywhere you know and and they're not necessarily very

958
01:18:56,489 --> 01:19:02,279
orderly so so anyways lots of my clients are really high in openness and they're

959
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,909
funny people often especially if they're smart because sometimes they have the

960
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:10,720
most nihilistic intelligence you can imagine it's just self-critical and

961
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,869
nihilistic and brutally brutal man and smart and so they just criticize

962
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:22,579
themselves out of existence and so often I have to just try to get them to quit

963
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:26,890
listening to their chattering right self-critical rationality and go out and

964
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:30,900
create something you know with their massive creativity and as long as

965
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,359
they're doing that they're engaged in the world and happy as hell but as soon

966
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:38,469
as that self-critical rationality comes in and shuts down the creativity they're

967
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:43,369
just they're just like walking corpses you know and it's because if you're

968
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:48,630
really open like that's your a tree and it has some trunks and you know your

969
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:52,409
your most prominent trait is the most lively trunk and if you're a creative

970
01:19:52,409 --> 01:19:56,489
person and you're not engaging in a creative enterprise

971
01:19:56,489 --> 01:20:00,949
you're just you're like a tree that that has been that has had its vitality

972
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:07,359
amputated and so this is not trivial this stuff is this is deeply deeply

973
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:13,399
deeply rooted in your biology and and those are people often who have like

974
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:16,238
dream lives you just can't believe I have one client

975
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,169
he has like four spectacular dreams a week and most of the time we

976
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:25,930
just spend discussing them I mean God he and I had another client who could be

977
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:29,530
lucid in her dreams which is more common among women she could ask the damn

978
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:34,050
characters what they represented and they would tell her it was like okay

979
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,760
that was pretty weird and like a lot of the things they told her were really

980
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:43,970
helpful and they were not things that she wanted to hear she she basically one

981
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:47,659
of them told her she if she was gonna live she'd have to go visit a

982
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:52,829
slaughterhouse and the reason for that was because she was raised as a little

983
01:20:52,829 --> 01:20:57,640
princess and protected from horrible mother nature until she hit puberty in

984
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,840
which time she turned into an evil villain because that's how the family

985
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:06,670
worked perfect child evil teenager overnight and then well

986
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:09,600
that was hard on her and she wasn't prepared because she thought the world

987
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,011
was princess world and you know she couldn't go through a butcher store

988
01:21:13,011 --> 01:21:18,870
without having a fit and no wonder you know like really Jesus you know it's no

989
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:23,720
wonder but you do it but she couldn't so we used to go to butcher stores and that

990
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,619
would make her cry and and that she was a vegetarian that would make her cry and

991
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:32,970
you know bemoan the cruelty of the world and it's like yeah fair enough man those

992
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:36,670
are bloody slabs of meat it's like I don't know why everyone isn't screaming

993
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:41,489
when they walk through the butcher store but but you got to get used to it man

994
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:45,529
because you can't live in the world otherwise and so the dream character who

995
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:49,399
was a gypsy told her that she had to go visit a slaughterhouse which seemed

996
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:54,129
rather impractical and so I asked her if she could think of anything else to do

997
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:57,940
and she saw it well why don't we go visit a funeral home and and watch an

998
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:02,829
embalming and I thought oh how good that sounds that sounds like a fun way to

999
01:22:02,829 --> 01:22:10,640
spend a day and so I phoned up a funeral parlor and I said I had a client it was

1000
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,650
terrified of death yeah and I was the therapist who was also a little shaky on

1001
01:22:14,649 --> 01:22:20,619
the concept myself and so they they had no problem with that they deal with

1002
01:22:20,619 --> 01:22:23,609
death all the time which is really something to think about right a human

1003
01:22:23,609 --> 01:22:27,909
being can actually have an occupation where they do nothing but deal with

1004
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:32,210
death and they don't go stark raving mad it's like what the hell's up

1005
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,590
with that it's like working in a palliative care ward where your your

1006
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:39,970
clients that you you know have a relationship all they're gonna do is die

1007
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:44,940
this week next week the week after people do that it's like those people

1008
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:50,359
are tough man they're tough so anyways we went and watched this embalming which

1009
01:22:50,359 --> 01:22:56,689
was I have a rather high level of disgust sensitivity so it was a little

1010
01:22:56,689 --> 01:23:02,439
on the rough side for me but she sat there and first while she was not we

1011
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:06,519
were outside this little room she was not looking at that man no way and she

1012
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,020
kind of go like this and you know that was pretty good and then she'd go like

1013
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:17,330
this and then she go like this and then and she watched it and then she asked if

1014
01:23:17,329 --> 01:23:21,109
she could go in and she put on the glove and she touched the body and she didn't

1015
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:26,349
have a fit she didn't have a panic attack and so she walked away from there

1016
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:29,370
learning that there was a hell of a lot more to her than she thought there was

1017
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:33,439
and that she could see things that she didn't think she could see and live and

1018
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,339
after that she sort of had a touchstone it's like well I'm kind of afraid of

1019
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,110
this well is it as bad as going to see the embalming

1020
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:44,460
no it's not that bad well I guess I can do it it's like an initiation right she

1021
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:50,119
had an initiation and so did I you know and I learned a lot from doing that I

1022
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:53,000
learned that one of the things you need to do if you're going to be a human

1023
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,529
being is to prepare yourself to be useful in the face of death and so when

1024
01:23:57,529 --> 01:24:01,699
you have a parent that dies which you know shatters people's ideas often they

1025
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:06,340
can't even think about it if you can't even think about that man you've got

1026
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,970
some thinking to do because you need to be able to at least think about that

1027
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:15,449
because otherwise you're just gonna be a wasteland when it happens and you never

1028
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:19,380
know you could even have a higher ambition maybe you could even be useful

1029
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:24,079
when it happens instead of being part of the heap of destroyed people who also

1030
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:29,229
have to be taken care of you know and that's brutal you have to be brutal to

1031
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:32,929
be useful in the aftermath of your parents death you know you don't get to

1032
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:39,670
crumble and fall apart and no you have every reason to so you got to be kind of

1033
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:43,520
some tough monster to manage that but you want to be useful in the face of

1034
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:54,050
tragedy or do you want to be well you make your choice so out of the

1035
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:58,340
unconscious you get ritual you get dreams you get drama you get stories you

1036
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:03,350
get art you get music and that sort of buffers us we have our little domain of

1037
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:07,970
competence and we're buffered by the domain of fantasy and culture and that's

1038
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,250
really what you learn about when you come to university if you're lucky and

1039
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,880
and the professors are smart enough to actually teach you something about

1040
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,279
culture instead of constantly telling you that it's completely reprehensible

1041
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,699
and should be destroyed it's like why you would prefer chaos to order is

1042
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:27,500
beyond me and the only possible reason is that you haven't read enough history

1043
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:33,039
to understand exactly what chaos means and believe me if you understood what it

1044
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:37,760
means you'd be pretty goddamn careful about tearing down the temple that you

1045
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:44,510
live in unless you want to be a denizen of chaos and some people do you know

1046
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:49,340
because that's when the impulses that you Harbor can really come out and shine

1047
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:54,810
and so a little gratitude is in order and that makes you appreciative of the

1048
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:59,630
wise King well being smart enough to know that he's also an evil tyrant it's

1049
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:04,420
like that's that's a total conception of the world it's balanced it's like yeah

1050
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,420
we should preserve nature but good god it is trying to kill us and you know

1051
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,970
yes our culture is tyrannical and oppressive people but it is protecting

1052
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:19,600
us from dying that's helpful you know and yes we're reasonably good people but

1053
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,260
like don't take that theory too far until you've tested yourself and you

1054
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:28,340
know that's wisdom at least in part and that's what these stories try to teach

1055
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:34,810
you there's a nice mythological

1056
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:40,670
representation I love this one it's like the Dome of the known and the seeker

1057
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:46,000
looking outside you know that's a that's a metaphysical representation you know

1058
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,371
and then that is the world as it looks to us right you go out in a field and it

1059
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:53,529
looks like there's a dome covering it it's a circle a big circle with a dome

1060
01:26:53,529 --> 01:26:57,909
over it and you know what's outside the dome well the unknown right that's where

1061
01:26:57,909 --> 01:27:01,559
heaven is theoretically you know it's a projection obviously

1062
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,590
heaven is in the unknown well it was localized in space

1063
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,430
I suppose that's partly because when people looked up in the sky they were

1064
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:15,610
overwhelmed with all so it's a reasonable conclusion you know it it's a

1065
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:19,519
projection of an unconscious presupposition it's a projection of

1066
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,930
fantasy you know heaven is a fantasy and and I'm not denigrating fantasy by the

1067
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:30,311
way and it's projected imaginatively onto the sky and that's part of the way

1068
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:35,880
you discover what's in your fantasy well this is us man we mediate between chaos

1069
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,760
and order and you know those are the two archetypal representations fundamentally

1070
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:47,880
you know and I think they apply to both genders you know like women can act as

1071
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:54,390
the individual who holds the world on his or her shoulders and males men can

1072
01:27:54,390 --> 01:28:00,650
play a maternal role you know meet female human beings are quite masculine

1073
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:04,979
and male human beings are quite feminine and so you know maybe maybe this

1074
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:09,649
archetype dominates among men and that archetype dominates among women which I

1075
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:13,539
would say is that is the case as far as I'm concerned although there in our

1076
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,840
individual conceptions and of course those two things have to work in

1077
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:24,659
conjunction but that's you the eternal mediator between chaos and order which

1078
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:31,439
also has its enemy so that's that's Horace there and that Seth who's

1079
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:37,488
eventually turns into Satan as though as the West progresses so to speak and

1080
01:28:37,488 --> 01:28:43,379
that's represented there as well the temptations of I would say resentment

1081
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:49,449
and hatred which everyone has to fight with all the time all right

1082
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:55,220
initiations so this is cool this is a standard hero story and initiate

1083
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:59,010
initiative rights are a part of human heritage and so let's take a look this

1084
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:02,090
is from el yada I would like even now to stress the fact

1085
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:06,590
that the psychopathology of the shamanic vocation is not profaned

1086
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:10,560
it does not belong to ordinary symptomatology it's not mental illness

1087
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,789
it has an int initiatory structure and signification

1088
01:29:13,789 --> 01:29:18,350
short it reproduces a traditional mystical pattern the total crisis of the

1089
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:22,070
future shaman sometimes leading to complete disintegration of the

1090
01:29:22,069 --> 01:29:26,949
personality and to madness can be valuated not only as an initiatory death

1091
01:29:26,949 --> 01:29:31,829
but also as a symbolic returned to the pre cosmogonic chaos to the amorphous

1092
01:29:31,829 --> 01:29:35,970
and indescribable state that precedes any comes Morgan II well what he means

1093
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:40,570
by that is that I suppose the mythological view of the emergence of

1094
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:46,309
order that's a cosmogony is that there's a state of potential and chaos out of

1095
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:52,560
which order emerges and you know here's here's how it is that you think that way

1096
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,750
because you do think that way so you know imagine what you're facing when

1097
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,590
you're facing the future right well you might say well the future is full of

1098
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:05,860
potential right it's full of potential what the hell does that mean you know

1099
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:10,729
you act as if that you act as if that potential is really a real thing and

1100
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:14,089
you're confronting it all the time I'm confronting the potential of the future

1101
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:19,199
well it doesn't exist yet so did what you're confronting doesn't even really

1102
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,949
exist what you're conceptualizing doesn't really exist and in some sense

1103
01:30:22,949 --> 01:30:27,970
you bring it into being by plotting your path through it well the pre cosmogonic

1104
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:32,340
chaos is the same as the potential of the future it's exactly the same idea

1105
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:39,489
it's the realm of possibility from which actuality emerges and you participate in

1106
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:44,449
turning that possibility into actuality that's what you're doing all the time

1107
01:30:44,449 --> 01:30:52,220
now can I explain that well no I have no idea how consciousness and the substrate

1108
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:56,451
of the world interact i I can only say that that's how it

1109
01:30:56,451 --> 01:31:01,029
looks that's how it feels you know that's how people act and

1110
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:05,840
they'll get into trouble if they don't manifest their potential whatever that

1111
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,760
is that's all those things you could be that you're not well where are those

1112
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:18,920
it's just potential well that's the chaos this is a that's the I would say

1113
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:23,199
that's the the cosmos that's the cosmos that you live in all the time it's a

1114
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:27,118
little story it's the thing that you extract out of the chaos it's

1115
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:31,988
- consists of your conception of where you are now and your conception of where

1116
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:36,319
you want to be at some point could be ten minutes could be three years if you

1117
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:41,909
can slide it and then you have a little plan about how you should move your body

1118
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:46,359
to do transform one in into the other that's your action powder and that's a

1119
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:49,988
little story and when you ask someone to say what they were up to you they'll

1120
01:31:49,988 --> 01:31:54,149
tell you a little story like that you know I was at some place and I went

1121
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:56,920
somewhere else and here's how I did it then they might tell you more

1122
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:03,199
interesting story which is I was someplace and something happened that I

1123
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:09,779
really didn't expect and it knocked me for a loop you know and that's a good

1124
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:16,488
divorce story I came home one night and my wife was gone it's like yeah chaos

1125
01:32:16,488 --> 01:32:21,279
and probably a bit of willful blindness preceding it we might suspect

1126
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:25,349
anyways down into chaos and then well maybe you learn something down there and

1127
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:28,410
maybe you don't but hopefully you do and you put yourself together if you're

1128
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:33,649
lucky and then pop bang you pop up into another little structure of order and

1129
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:38,969
that's an initiatory process it's like you're some more stable falls apart or

1130
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:43,550
maybe you break it apart on purpose you do it voluntarily you know people do

1131
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:47,770
that all the time you know they do that for example when they experiment with

1132
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:51,511
drugs and they do that when they go on wild adventures and you know when they

1133
01:32:51,511 --> 01:32:56,260
break themselves out of their normal routine and throw themselves somewhere

1134
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:00,170
they don't understand and hope that that's going to produce a transformation

1135
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:05,310
of personality that's the basic story that's the initiatory story now this is

1136
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:10,160
William James who was the one of the establishes of modern psychology and a

1137
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:14,229
kind of an odd guy he was an early experimenter with psychedelics of course

1138
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:18,939
they'll never tell you that but he was and he is his drug of choice was nitrous

1139
01:33:18,939 --> 01:33:24,329
oxide which is an inhalant gas which seems to be inert no one really knows

1140
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:29,840
why it works but it produces quite intense hallucinogenic experience

1141
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,529
mystical experience although if you breathe too much of it then you die

1142
01:33:33,529 --> 01:33:38,539
because it doesn't it doesn't have any oxygen in it so so don't do that and and

1143
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:41,079
he wrote some really bad hippie poetry back

1144
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:47,609
in the 1880s well he was you know experimenting with with nitrous oxide

1145
01:33:47,609 --> 01:33:51,889
I'll read a little bit of that to you pure experience is the name which I give

1146
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:57,630
to the original flux of life before a reflection has categorized it only

1147
01:33:57,630 --> 01:34:01,829
newborn babes in persons in semi coma from sleep drugs illnesses or blows can

1148
01:34:01,829 --> 01:34:06,680
have an experience pure in the literal sense of that which is not yet any

1149
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:13,380
definite what though ready to be any sorts of what's both full both of

1150
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:18,840
oneness and of many 'no specs that don't appear changing throughout yet so

1151
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,860
confusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no points either of

1152
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:29,729
distinction or of identity can be caught 1905 William James Journal of philosophy

1153
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:34,759
you know a lot of these old guys that established what we regard is you know

1154
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:39,180
fairly stable bodies of knowledge we're just as crazy as you could possibly

1155
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:43,980
imagine they're just the most peculiar damn people and they get sanitized you

1156
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:49,379
know as they are represented in history and that's no fun you know I mean it's

1157
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:53,739
much more interesting to know what they were like they were just so bloody

1158
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:58,468
peculiar and and strange and involved in all sorts of weird things that's a lot

1159
01:34:58,469 --> 01:35:01,969
more fun to know that here's his poem Wow

1160
01:35:01,969 --> 01:35:08,510
it's like right from 1968 no verbiage can give it because the verbiage is

1161
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:14,469
other incoherent coherent same and it fades and it's infinite and it's

1162
01:35:14,469 --> 01:35:18,909
infinite don't you see the difference don't you see the identity constantly

1163
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:24,069
opposites United the same me telling you to write and not to write extreme

1164
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:29,659
extreme extreme something and other than that thing intoxication and other nest

1165
01:35:29,659 --> 01:35:34,029
and intoxication every attempt at betterment every attempt at other menthe

1166
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:39,630
is a it fades forever and forever as we move it's like it's just about as

1167
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:46,150
incoherent as post modernist philosophy so we know for archaic and traditional

1168
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:50,089
cultures that a symbolic return to chaos is equivalent to preparing a new

1169
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:53,690
creation it follows that we may interpret the psychic chaos of the

1170
01:35:53,689 --> 01:35:57,379
future shaman as assigned the profane man is being dissolved and a

1171
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:02,510
new personality being prepared for birth transformation here's a way of thinking

1172
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:08,320
about it paradise Paradise Lost redemption classic story

1173
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,509
of mankind always it was a great past we're in a state of chaos we're heading

1174
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:19,860
towards a better future everyone thinks that way the stories are based on that

1175
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:27,409
well that's that now Ellen Burch a who wrote a lot about the psychoanalysts

1176
01:36:27,409 --> 01:36:30,719
believed that Freud and Jung in particular had a creative illness which

1177
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:35,569
he regarded as a sort of spontaneous shamanic transformation and he said a

1178
01:36:35,569 --> 01:36:39,909
creative illness has these elements it follow succeeds a period of intense

1179
01:36:39,909 --> 01:36:44,430
preoccupation with an idea and search for certain truth it's a polymorphous

1180
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:47,880
condition that can take the shape of depression neurosis psychosomatic

1181
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,930
ailments or even psychosis Jung was in that state when he wrote this book

1182
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:55,280
called the red book which was just released last year which is full of

1183
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:03,238
visionary illustrations and hands very strange poetry and it contains the the

1184
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:08,529
communications he had with imaginative beings that he conjured up when when

1185
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:13,029
practicing doing exactly that he practiced that for years and he had

1186
01:37:13,029 --> 01:37:17,920
these autonomous beings manifest themselves in his fantasy it had long

1187
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,510
conversations with them it just you know while he was working as a doctor and

1188
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:28,320
having a sane normal life and well it's kind of well it's really something

1189
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,509
whatever the symptoms they're felt is painful while he thought maybe he was

1190
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:36,210
going mad and some people think he did if not agonizing by the subject with

1191
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:39,279
alternating periods of alleviation and worsening throughout the illness the

1192
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:44,439
subject never loses the thread of his dominating preoccupation it's often

1193
01:37:44,439 --> 01:37:47,839
compatible with normal professional activity and family life but even if he

1194
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,119
keeps to his social activities he's almost entirely absorbed with

1195
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:57,488
himself he suffers from feelings of utter isolation even when he has a

1196
01:37:57,488 --> 01:38:01,009
mentor who guides him through the ordeal like the shaman apprentice with his

1197
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:05,469
master the termination is often rapid and marked by a phase of exhilaration

1198
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:08,949
the subject emerges from his ordeal with a permanent Tran

1199
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:12,109
formation in his personality and a conviction that he has discovered a

1200
01:38:12,109 --> 01:38:19,659
great truth or a new spiritual world many of the 19th and 20th century

1201
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:24,340
figures regarded universally as great Nietzsche Darwin Dostoyevsky Tolstoy

1202
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:27,710
Freud Jung were all additionally characterized by lengthy periods of

1203
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:30,319
profound psychological unrest and uncertainty

1204
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:36,109
well you don't generate a new theory without some birth pangs right because

1205
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:39,839
your old theory has to bite the dust first and when your old theory bites the

1206
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,140
dust it's like where are you you don't know do you know if you're gonna come up

1207
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:51,380
with a new one no here's a cool thing this is my daughter she was five years

1208
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:53,880
at this point she was playing prince or in princess

1209
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,180
with Julie and her three-year-old she said dad if we killed a dragon we could

1210
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:01,340
use his skin as armor wouldn't that be a good idea I thought

1211
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:05,279
hey yeah that's that's a hell of an idea kid you know you go right after the

1212
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,279
thing that frightens you the most and you develop something that protects you

1213
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:12,590
from doing that it's like where did she get that idea

1214
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:22,590
well good work kiddo she had plenty of dragons in her life so the following

1215
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,819
dream was described by my daughter Mikayla three years nine months old

1216
01:39:25,819 --> 01:39:30,569
about my son Julian one year Julian was in the process of toilet training and

1217
01:39:30,569 --> 01:39:34,259
rapid speech development was having some trouble controlling his emotions Mikayla

1218
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:37,239
liked to call him baby we had several discussions about the

1219
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:40,679
fact that he wasn't really a baby anymore she told me this story while I

1220
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,200
was at the computer so I was able to get it for Batum she wasn't very happy with

1221
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:47,929
the idea that he wasn't a baby anymore because she kind of liked the baby she

1222
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:51,450
took care of that baby a lot and her little brain was having a hard time with

1223
01:39:51,449 --> 01:39:55,449
the notion that whatever that thing is now it isn't a baby it's like well

1224
01:39:55,449 --> 01:39:59,359
where's my baby and believe me plenty of mothers go through the same thing then

1225
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:03,670
they attempt to keep their children babies for the rest of their lives so

1226
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:07,359
this is what Mikayla said the dream Julian's eyes fell out and then he

1227
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:13,049
falled into pieces I said what sort of pieces she said Julian pieces and the

1228
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:17,460
bones fall doubt too then a hole got him and there was water in it and when he

1229
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:22,480
came out he was big mom Julian isn't a baby anymore no he

1230
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,759
a big boy and a bug with legs got him out cuz bugs can swim and the whole was

1231
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,520
in the park and it moved into the backyard and he fall into it a tree

1232
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:36,180
burned and left the hole I thought wow that's so amazing it's like it was a it

1233
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:40,470
was a shamanic transformation dream it was like the tree that's The Tree of

1234
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:44,719
Life had burnt and left a hole the kid fell into it it dissolved him right down

1235
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:49,840
to his bones this little bug which would be a union representation of the self

1236
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,880
like Jiminy Cricket by the way in Pinocchio the bug was the thing that was

1237
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,869
alive that helped him through the transformation he stepped out and now he

1238
01:40:56,869 --> 01:41:01,989
was big it's like that was her little brain conjuring up the notion of radical

1239
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:07,649
transformation so this is cool I hope this works

1240
01:41:07,649 --> 01:41:12,988
this is a dream that my my nephew had did someone animated Jordan Peterson is

1241
01:41:12,988 --> 01:41:16,750
a clinical psychologist from the University of Toronto Maya do disagree

1242
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,979
with some of his fundamental ideas but his thoughts and facing problems merge

1243
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:27,169
with my stoic values within one of his maps of meaning lectures he tells a true

1244
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:31,880
story about a four year old boy his nephew who for months was suffering from

1245
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:37,409
terrible night terrors terrors that were waking him up screaming this boy by the

1246
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:42,029
way did have some areas of instability in his family life Jordan visited the

1247
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:46,819
young boy's house and the boy was running around dressed as an eight with

1248
01:41:46,819 --> 01:41:49,840
a sword a shield and a helmet at night aim he would take a sword and shield to

1249
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:54,949
bed so Jordan got speaking to him and the boy described his dream and the

1250
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:59,689
dream he's standing surrounded by knee-high Dwarfs these dwarves had beaks

1251
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:04,639
and every time you would try to move the dwarfs would jump up and bait him a very

1252
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:09,300
fretting scenario for a young boy and if you look behind all the dwarfs away in

1253
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,820
the background there was a dragon and every time this dragon would puff out

1254
01:42:12,819 --> 01:42:17,399
fire and smoke more dwarfs would be created so there's no point fighting off

1255
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:20,079
the dwarfs because more would just be me it

1256
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:24,899
so Jordan tapped him and asked what could you do about that so the kid says

1257
01:42:24,899 --> 01:42:29,609
he could jump up on the Dragons head he could poke out his eyes with a sword so

1258
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:34,049
he couldn't see then they could go go down the throat to the box where the

1259
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:39,739
fire came from carve a piece out of that box thereby destroying it and use that

1260
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:45,559
piece as a sheet its shamed before Jordan arrived was already a keynote in

1261
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:50,810
life what he knew he had to do and after that conversation he had no more Nate

1262
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:56,330
pears this is what Marcus really is meant when he said the impediment to

1263
01:42:56,329 --> 01:43:02,430
action advances action what stands in the way becomes the way he was tell not

1264
01:43:02,430 --> 01:43:06,090
us that we must not shy away from problems or shown or personal

1265
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:10,770
responsibility we must be willing to sacrifice her comfort Goethe source of

1266
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:17,800
her problems to solve them and then take something away well there you go so yeah

1267
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,010
he was waking up screaming at night for four weeks

1268
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:24,360
that's night terrorist he couldn't really remember what hell was going on

1269
01:43:24,359 --> 01:43:28,859
and there was instability and his family his parents got divorced soon after and

1270
01:43:28,859 --> 01:43:33,229
he was off to kindergarten and that was kind of destabilizing him too and so it

1271
01:43:33,229 --> 01:43:37,339
was fun to watch him zip around as a knight it's like you know where'd he get

1272
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:42,239
that idea well you know he watched TV watch movies see his little imagination

1273
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:46,889
was aggregating the picture of the hero and then he was trying to act it out

1274
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:50,570
that's what he was doing pretending right I'm pretending to be the thing

1275
01:43:50,569 --> 01:43:54,590
that takes on the unknown and then he has this amazing dream it's like it's

1276
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:58,409
mind-boggling it's so sophisticated it's like well here I am

1277
01:43:58,409 --> 01:44:02,609
and there's troubles everywhere and they're biting me they're jumping up on

1278
01:44:02,609 --> 01:44:06,989
me and it's like a Hydra you know in the Hydra you cut off a hydras head and

1279
01:44:06,989 --> 01:44:11,460
seven more heads grow it's like that's life man solve one problem seven more

1280
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:17,550
appear right so also that that was the Dragons at the background chaos itself

1281
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:23,770
and chaos kept breeding these are the evil little Dwarfs which is what it does

1282
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:26,890
it's like it's one damn trouble after another we fight this one off fight this

1283
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:31,210
one off it's like who cares the dragon the dwarf generating machine is still

1284
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:35,439
working in the background so he I asked him and that was purposeful what

1285
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:39,819
could you do see that's a leading question that

1286
01:44:39,819 --> 01:44:44,359
implies that there's something that he could do he said well I take my dad that

1287
01:44:44,359 --> 01:44:49,399
was missing in the animation and we go well poke the dragon's eyes out go right

1288
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:54,769
down to the source of the problem extinguish it make a shield right so

1289
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:57,831
that meant that he would have strengthened his character by the

1290
01:44:57,831 --> 01:45:05,680
encounter so brilliant and then and I talked to his mom for months afterwards

1291
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:11,320
done no more night terrors what had happened he identified with the

1292
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:15,299
mythological hero he did identified with st. George and the dragon he identified

1293
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:20,739
with that little bloody tree dwelling primate who 20 million years ago was the

1294
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:26,679
first one to drop a stick on a snake he adopted the classic human mode of being

1295
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:34,240
in the face of uncertainty and construed himself as that which could prevail end

1296
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:46,300
of terrors well I guess we're done E so we're gonna do something a little

1297
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:50,880
different than the syllabus today because you know we got this one hour to

1298
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,829
our problem and I really can't cover constructionism reasonably in two hours

1299
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:57,819
or one hour that was supposed to be today

1300
01:45:57,819 --> 01:46:02,170
so what I'm going to do is instead is continue on the line that I've been

1301
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:07,239
pursuing but I'm going to expand it up more into Union psychology which is the

1302
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:11,250
what we're going after after constructivism anyways and so I can

1303
01:46:11,251 --> 01:46:15,320
weave the constructivism and the depth psychology together and it's nice to do

1304
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:19,090
that because it gives you a kind of a coherent view so just so you know we're

1305
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:23,650
one lecture ahead at the moment roughly speaking and I'll do constructivism on

1306
01:46:23,649 --> 01:46:29,129
Tuesday for two hours so all right so I showed you that anime animation I told

1307
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:33,960
you about my nephew's dream which is a remarkable dream you know really it's

1308
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:40,609
just amazing amazing dream and it's it's got this archetypal pattern you know and

1309
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:45,339
the pattern is that there's a threat and worse than not that there's there are

1310
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:49,230
threats and at the back of it there is the the

1311
01:46:49,229 --> 01:46:55,089
fact of threat itself you see so human beings were so smart hey so this is so

1312
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:59,840
amazing that we figured this out so you imagine well human beings are the only

1313
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,550
creatures that can really conceive of the class of all threatening things

1314
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:07,219
right and that's kind of why we can be permanently anxious there's so it's sort

1315
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:13,510
of annoying so you know here you are and it's safe there's no Lions here or or

1316
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:19,260
anything that might prey on you but you can think of something to be anxious

1317
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:23,500
about no problem you know I'm certain you've got some little skeleton rattling

1318
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:28,810
around in your closet somewhere that's like eating away at you and so I think

1319
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:33,280
part of the reason we're so damn awake human beings is because we're always

1320
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:38,969
anxious like and you have to be awake when you're anxious and the the anxiety

1321
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:42,909
system actually activates your reticular activating system and that that that

1322
01:47:42,909 --> 01:47:49,510
actually produces its the substrate for consciousness if you snap a few fibers

1323
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:53,190
in the back of your brain that are part of the reticulating activate reticular

1324
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:56,629
activating system in a car accident or something you'll go into a coma and

1325
01:47:56,630 --> 01:48:00,050
that'll be that here you're not getting out of it doesn't take much of an injury

1326
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:05,090
either in the right place so anyways so human beings have been struggling with

1327
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:10,980
this problem of threat forever really for as long as there's been life

1328
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:14,279
or at least as long as there's been life with a nervous system and you know

1329
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:20,550
that's several hundred million years it's a long time and of course it's easy

1330
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:24,400
to you know to respond to a particular threat think about zebras they're out

1331
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,109
there on the veldt and there's lions everywhere right but the zebras are like

1332
01:48:28,109 --> 01:48:32,839
they're calmed because there's lions are sleeping and so the zebras don't think

1333
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:38,239
apparently oh my god what was going to happen with those Lions wake up because

1334
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:41,389
they don't think that way you know and they're not going to be happy if the

1335
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:45,980
lion goes into a hunting Crouch and starts its hunting approach obviously

1336
01:48:45,979 --> 01:48:50,569
but it's not like the zebras are freaking out non-stop because there are

1337
01:48:50,569 --> 01:48:55,460
Lions around you know so they can react to specific threats but human beings

1338
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:59,560
partly because we discovered the future which was a big mistake was a big

1339
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,900
mistake because the future is an uncertain place

1340
01:49:02,899 --> 01:49:06,779
we realized that well there isn't any threat right now but there might well be

1341
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:10,599
some tomorrow and if there isn't some tomorrow well maybe next week or next

1342
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:15,880
month or next year like it's coming and so there's danger so it's the category

1343
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:21,010
of danger you know and out of the category of danger emerged specific

1344
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:27,320
threats and the dragon seems to be a symbol of it is a symbol I believe of

1345
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:33,340
the ever-present fact of predatory slightly predatory threat but our

1346
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:37,900
nervous systems as they've become capable of abstraction have used that

1347
01:49:37,899 --> 01:49:42,710
underlying architecture to represent more abstract categories so it's not

1348
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:46,119
it's not a predator like a dragon is not a predator because there are no dragons

1349
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:51,729
but maybe a dragon is a snake and a and a crocodile and maybe a leopard and

1350
01:49:51,729 --> 01:49:56,569
maybe a predatory bird all mangled into one monster because a monster is

1351
01:49:56,569 --> 01:50:00,069
actually technically something that's made out of disparate parts and so it's

1352
01:50:00,069 --> 01:50:05,369
a good symbolic representation for the unknown as such that which lies beyond

1353
01:50:05,369 --> 01:50:10,309
the campfire let's say and what lurks out there and so the eternal problem is

1354
01:50:10,310 --> 01:50:14,690
what the hell do you do with the dragon and that also explains why the dragon

1355
01:50:14,689 --> 01:50:18,939
typically is a treasure garter right because it's even more the problem is

1356
01:50:18,939 --> 01:50:23,339
even worse out there in no-man's land out there in potential

1357
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:27,420
there's threat and and and like mortal threat but there's also endless

1358
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:32,520
opportunity and riches and wealth and and and the possibility of attracting

1359
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:35,610
someone and all of that and so well the dragon

1360
01:50:35,609 --> 01:50:39,630
you can't just be afraid of it you just stay in your burrow the whole time and

1361
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:43,469
lots of animals more or less do that is you know especially the nocturnal ones

1362
01:50:43,469 --> 01:50:46,590
they just hide away but that is what human beings alight because we're not

1363
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:50,390
only prey animals right we're also predators and then of course we're crazy

1364
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:54,910
we're absolutely insane chimpanzees right we're crazy and so we're always

1365
01:50:54,909 --> 01:51:00,069
out there mucking about with things and with our you know fingers and and our

1366
01:51:00,069 --> 01:51:04,549
thumbs and and taking the world apart and putting it back together and we're

1367
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:09,310
crazily exploratory and and in troublemaking and so we don't just run

1368
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:17,550
from dragons we go hunt them down and so and so there's a story here there's the

1369
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,909
oldest story that mankind knows and literally it is the oldest story that we

1370
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:26,059
know is this stories in this story basically is there's a bounded space a

1371
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:29,760
walled garden a walled city you know on all the original cities were walled

1372
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:34,350
because if they weren't barbarians would swoop in and they'd just steal all your

1373
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:38,010
stuff and so you know that was kind of pointless so you know you wanted to have

1374
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:42,920
some major-league walls surrounding your territory and so that's inhabited space

1375
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,199
and inside that is here little dominance hierarchy and so all you primates knew

1376
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:50,730
exactly who was who inside that space so you didn't have to fight with each other

1377
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:54,050
and you could predict each other's behavior because you believed the same

1378
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:58,029
things and saw the world roughly the same way and acted the same way and so

1379
01:51:58,029 --> 01:52:02,009
you were sort of secure but then the problem is is that that can always be

1380
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:05,510
breached there's always something outside of it that's a danger and so

1381
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:12,010
that's signified by this this little creature here this is dragon and that

1382
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:16,449
that twirl in its tail is very common among dragons actually it's actually a

1383
01:52:16,448 --> 01:52:21,679
symbol because you imagistic languages imagistic symbols have an ancient

1384
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:26,270
language and it it's referring to something that's basically eternal and

1385
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:30,550
so it lives down here in this in this cave because it's an underground thing

1386
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:33,449
it's an underground thing and you can kind of imagine what that's like and

1387
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:37,550
sometimes this happens in initiation rituals among archaic people they're

1388
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:40,610
gonna when they're gonna initiate usually the young men because nature

1389
01:52:40,609 --> 01:52:45,009
initiates women know by itself usually the young men maybe they'll put them in

1390
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:49,680
a cave and leave them there you know for like well who know who knows how long

1391
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:54,180
and Sagada think what's in a cave that caves are dark man I don't know if

1392
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:59,110
you've ever been in one but like they're dark and they're really dark and so not

1393
01:52:59,109 --> 01:53:02,759
only is there whatever there is in the cave and you don't know what the hell's

1394
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:07,260
in the cave there's whatever you imagined might be in the cave and so

1395
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,969
when you're in that cave and you're alone you you're confronting the devils

1396
01:53:10,969 --> 01:53:14,819
and demons and monsters of your own imagination you know and so then you

1397
01:53:14,819 --> 01:53:18,509
have a chance to perhaps deal with that and overcome it and that's perhaps part

1398
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:22,909
of the initiation ceremony you know and that's part of growing up because you

1399
01:53:22,909 --> 01:53:27,930
have to learn how to face the things that terrify and upset you and

1400
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:31,780
and we cast them and put them back together we talked a little bit about

1401
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:38,719
this idea of the pre cosmogonic chaos that that Iliad it refers to and and

1402
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:43,310
that's this stuff out of which order is produced at the beginning of time and

1403
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:48,110
it's also the stuff out of which you constantly reproduce order and the young

1404
01:53:48,109 --> 01:53:52,969
unions the psychoanalysts especially the really deep psychoanalysts like young

1405
01:53:52,969 --> 01:53:56,469
Freud was a more surface psychoanalyst and that's not an insult there's some

1406
01:53:56,469 --> 01:53:59,840
things that Freud figured out they're absolutely amazing he was a precursor to

1407
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:05,260
Jung for sure for Jung the hero's journey was the journey inside the

1408
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:10,360
unconscious and that would be perhaps in some sense that the the willingness to

1409
01:54:10,359 --> 01:54:13,429
face everything terrible that's happened to you and to think it through and to

1410
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:17,340
articulate it and and to come to grips perhaps with your own capacity for

1411
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:22,190
malevolence that was a really important part of Union ideas that the first step

1412
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:26,099
towards individuation which is the manifestation of your full self let's

1413
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:31,219
say was the discovery of your shadow and your shadow is the part of you that will

1414
01:54:31,219 --> 01:54:35,390
do terrible things under the right circumstances and maybe even without

1415
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:39,610
that much provocation and you know and it's a terrifying part of you to come

1416
01:54:39,609 --> 01:54:42,979
into contact with because it's sort of it's sort of the way that you're

1417
01:54:42,979 --> 01:54:46,750
specifically attached to the archetype of evil that's a that's a good way of

1418
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,710
thinking about it and you know modern people they don't really think much

1419
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:53,180
about think much about the idea of good and evil but that's because the most of

1420
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:58,150
them are so they I'm naive you can just barely even comprehend it you know if

1421
01:54:58,149 --> 01:55:04,000
you read any history if you really read it like and you and you don't come away

1422
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,579
with the idea that evil exists it's like you're just reading the wrong kind of

1423
01:55:07,579 --> 01:55:13,529
history you know it's just unbelievable what people can do to each other and

1424
01:55:13,529 --> 01:55:17,439
we're so imaginative you know and one of the things I figured out about people

1425
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,909
the reason that we're we have the knowledge of good and evil let's say is

1426
01:55:21,909 --> 01:55:26,130
that because we're self conscious and we know about ourselves we know about our

1427
01:55:26,131 --> 01:55:30,340
own vulnerability right you know what hurts you you really know what hurts you

1428
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:34,180
way more than an animal knows and so when you're all so creative and so once

1429
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:38,469
you know what hurts you man you can really hurt someone else and you can do

1430
01:55:38,469 --> 01:55:41,590
it in such a creative way you can draw it out you can

1431
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:45,699
make it excruciating you can take people apart physically and psychologically and

1432
01:55:45,698 --> 01:55:49,488
you can keep them say even right on the edge of death so that you can keep doing

1433
01:55:49,488 --> 01:55:54,409
that endlessly and you know that happens hell of a lot more than you think it

1434
01:55:54,409 --> 01:56:00,590
happens it happens a lot and so well and you think well you know that doesn't

1435
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:04,610
involve me it's like oh yes it does man that's the problem because you know

1436
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:07,759
you're human and that's the sort of things that human beings are capable of

1437
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:13,320
and I'm not saying you're all it's all probable that you do that ever or or

1438
01:56:13,319 --> 01:56:18,859
that but I'm saying that you know you got to take that into account when

1439
01:56:18,859 --> 01:56:21,380
you're looking at the world and you think about all the perpetrators out

1440
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:26,050
there it's like it's not like there's perpetrators and there's victims that

1441
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:30,449
isn't how it works it doesn't work that way at all and so the horrors of

1442
01:56:30,448 --> 01:56:34,639
humanity as well as the noble elements of humanity are all elements of your

1443
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:39,640
central being and for you and this is the terrible thing for young the pathway

1444
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:43,869
to higher wisdom was through the terrible portal of well you could say

1445
01:56:43,869 --> 01:56:49,719
hell for that matter really in and so who wants to do that man it's like no

1446
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:52,630
you know like maybe you're resentful about something well you probably are

1447
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:56,180
because like everybody's resentful about something you know and resentment is

1448
01:56:56,180 --> 01:57:01,510
just vicious emotion it's really useful it's really useful because if you're

1449
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:05,780
resentful about something it either means that you should grow the hell up

1450
01:57:05,779 --> 01:57:10,819
and accept the responsibility and quit sniveling around and whining or it means

1451
01:57:10,819 --> 01:57:14,488
that someone actually is oppressing you and and pushing on you too hard and

1452
01:57:14,488 --> 01:57:20,468
bullying you and demeaning you and you have something to say or do that you're

1453
01:57:20,469 --> 01:57:24,421
not saying or doing and no wonder you're not saying or doing it because you know

1454
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:30,840
it can be really dangerous to say things or do them to free yourself from from

1455
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:34,260
being oppressed you can get in a lot of trouble in the short term for doing it

1456
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:38,980
so it's easier just to not say anything sort of day after day in the short term

1457
01:57:38,979 --> 01:57:43,459
you protect yourself but just crushes you and then the the resentment comes up

1458
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:47,779
and resentment and that can just get so out of hand you know it starts with

1459
01:57:47,779 --> 01:57:51,909
resentment and then it starts it goes to the desire for revenge

1460
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:54,659
you know because you'll play nasty little tricks on the person that's

1461
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:56,849
opressing you at any chance you'll talk about them

1462
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:00,300
behind their back and if they want you to do something you'll do it badly or

1463
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:03,489
you'll do it grudgingly or you'll do a half rate job and you'll set up little

1464
01:58:03,488 --> 01:58:08,750
traps and you know so it puts you in a poisonous space and then if that if you

1465
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:13,079
really start to dwell on that say in your basement for three or four years

1466
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:16,529
about just exactly how terrible the world is and how that's focused on you

1467
01:58:16,529 --> 01:58:20,099
and how everyone's rejected you and how you get to this point where you're

1468
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:25,090
thinking that you know existence itself is a kind of poisonous endeavor and that

1469
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:28,510
the best thing for you to do is go out there and do as much you know create as

1470
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:33,430
much mayhem as you possibly can and if you really get to a dark place you think

1471
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:37,340
I'm going to create as much mayhem as I possibly can by targeting the most

1472
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:41,159
innocent thing I can possibly imagine and then you end up shooting kids in

1473
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:46,819
Connecticut and that's how you get there and so that's a bad road man there's

1474
01:58:46,819 --> 01:58:51,509
dark things down there but you can go there and people do and they go through

1475
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:57,430
the hole of resentment and so resentment can tell you you've got something to say

1476
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:02,200
you bloody well better say it you've got a free yourself from what's oppressing

1477
01:59:02,199 --> 01:59:06,679
you you have to stand up for that because otherwise you become oppressed

1478
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:12,650
and then once you're oppressed that's just not so good and so like in your

1479
01:59:12,649 --> 01:59:17,319
marriage and your relationships you got to tell people what you're thinking you

1480
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:21,119
don't have to assume you're right that's a whole different story because you're

1481
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:25,960
not cuz you're you know ignorant and you're biased and you know so you're not

1482
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:32,198
right but you can stumble towards your this the expression of yourself and then

1483
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:35,960
you can listen to the other person and hope that they tell you some way that

1484
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:39,619
you're stupid that's useful so you can be a little less stupid in the future

1485
01:59:39,619 --> 01:59:45,859
because that wouldn't that be good and so you know you go after the unknown you

1486
01:59:45,859 --> 01:59:50,589
don't protect what you know you already know what you know you go after what you

1487
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:54,140
don't know that's why you have to talk to people you don't agree with that's

1488
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:57,150
where you have to talk to your enemies because they're gonna tell you things

1489
01:59:57,149 --> 02:00:00,049
you don't know you could even listen to them it's possible they know a thing or

1490
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:03,719
two you don't know but people don't like that you know they just talk to people

1491
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:08,569
who think the same way and then they just stay stupid and so that's and

1492
02:00:08,569 --> 02:00:12,359
that's not because if you're not wise the world

1493
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:17,939
will wallop you it'll flatten you and and far more than it has to and then

1494
02:00:17,939 --> 02:00:21,349
you'll be better and resentful and you'll be part of that force that

1495
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:26,710
Wallops instead of the force that fights against that so well so you go after the

1496
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:30,460
dragon and that's what that's what this guy is doing he's going after the dragon

1497
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:34,640
it's it's threatening the society because it always does chaos what's

1498
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:40,500
outside of order always threatens order always always and so you have to step

1499
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:46,090
forward you know in this manner voluntarily and and and go after that

1500
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:49,710
when it's still manageable right and that's the case in your own life too so

1501
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:54,010
you know if you're if you've had a proclivity to be bullied in the past you

1502
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:57,489
know and you want to get out of that what you have to do is you have to make

1503
02:00:57,489 --> 02:01:05,399
yourself awake to the to the Maite to the to the what would you say to the to

1504
02:01:05,399 --> 02:01:09,339
the initial stages of that sort of bullying emerging in your life again

1505
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:14,219
that sort of domination and you have to step forward against it when it's still

1506
02:01:14,219 --> 02:01:18,039
in its developing stages because maybe you can just not have it happen that

1507
02:01:18,039 --> 02:01:24,010
would be better and so you have to be ready to speak what you have to say more

1508
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:28,150
or less at a moment's notice you can't be impulsive about it you know like if

1509
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:31,269
you and I are talking and you make a mistake or I make a mistake

1510
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:34,910
even if it's bothers one or the other of us we should just write it off because

1511
02:01:34,909 --> 02:01:38,369
it's like one encounter what the hell you you know maybe we had a bad night's

1512
02:01:38,369 --> 02:01:42,699
sleep or something you know you gotta be a little forgiving and what if it

1513
02:01:42,699 --> 02:01:46,559
happens twice then you know you should be a little awake and you should

1514
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,800
remember both times and then if it happens a third time it's like that's

1515
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:56,300
when you that's when you act and you say look we talked and this happened and I

1516
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:59,719
thought yeah whatever and but then you did it again

1517
02:01:59,719 --> 02:02:03,800
and then you just did it again well then the person is basically like what are

1518
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,760
they gonna do you know no well maybe they might argue with you but you kind

1519
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:13,289
of got them and you're generally if you just point that out to people just like

1520
02:02:13,289 --> 02:02:16,488
that just that you noticed and they're willing to say something about it

1521
02:02:16,488 --> 02:02:20,218
they'll back the hell off they'll often apologize and sometimes you even make

1522
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:22,719
them a little more conscious which is like hey that's

1523
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:28,069
not such a bad idea that's what all this means and so this caught this chaos idea

1524
02:02:28,069 --> 02:02:31,500
it's so for young it was the unconscious right it was the contents of your

1525
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:35,390
unconscious and so that might be the unknown past the threatening past that

1526
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:39,969
you have never dealt with there might be the threatening future it might be the

1527
02:02:39,969 --> 02:02:45,689
threatening present but you realized as his as he got older that that the

1528
02:02:45,689 --> 02:02:50,349
unconscious was also the world and you think and so the chaos is not only your

1529
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:54,430
unconscious mind which meets the unknown but it's actually the unknown itself

1530
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:59,440
mingled together you think what the hell does that that's why the dragon is a

1531
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,049
land creature and an air creature it's matter and spirit at the same time and

1532
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:07,010
this sort of gets us into constructivism because the constructivist think that

1533
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:10,719
basically what happens is that you encounter those elements of the world

1534
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:15,810
that don't fit into your theory and out of those new elements you make the world

1535
02:03:15,810 --> 02:03:18,730
through your perceptions and you make yourself by incorporating the

1536
02:03:18,729 --> 02:03:22,299
information and transforming yourself and that's how Piaget explains the

1537
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:26,340
development of a child if the child starts out with some reflexes basic

1538
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:30,779
reflexes and manifesting the reflexes produces results in the world and then

1539
02:03:30,779 --> 02:03:35,789
the child has to reorganize its perceptions to take into account the

1540
02:03:35,789 --> 02:03:39,001
transformations and so then it it gets a little more sophisticated and then it

1541
02:03:39,001 --> 02:03:43,010
can do a few more things and then it can manifest more changes in the world and

1542
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:47,430
then it martyr it attracts them and modifies its perceptions and actions to

1543
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:51,520
account for them and it just keeps doing that that's how the child boots itself

1544
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:57,350
up like a computer does it's a very cool idea and so from from the Piaget Gian

1545
02:03:57,350 --> 02:04:01,179
stance so it's constructive the stance you could think of the world as a latent

1546
02:04:01,179 --> 02:04:06,010
pool of information it's something like that with a structure obviously that you

1547
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:09,500
can interact with with your little fingers in your body and your mind and

1548
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:14,310
your eyes and your mouth and you make changes happen and you track them and

1549
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:19,340
you model them and you build your skills and as you continue to do that in the

1550
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:23,369
safety of your house initially under the care of your parents who who fill in

1551
02:04:23,369 --> 02:04:28,380
where you're ignorant you you you just emerge more and more competent and

1552
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:31,949
confident and ready to move ahead so that's that's how the constructivist

1553
02:04:31,948 --> 02:04:36,429
idea works and so so there's kind of a chaos idea at the bottom of that which

1554
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:41,550
is that out of which you emerge and the world emerges at the same time because

1555
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:46,619
you know you don't see reality not at all you see almost like an animated

1556
02:04:46,619 --> 02:04:50,189
version of reality you know like when I look at you I just see the front of you

1557
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:53,849
I just see the outside of you I see you at this height I don't see any of your

1558
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:58,079
internal structure I don't see the the back part of you at all I don't see your

1559
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:03,130
family I don't see your history I don't see your future you know I just see this

1560
02:05:03,130 --> 02:05:09,510
slice of you you're so complicated I just see this little like oversimplified

1561
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:13,800
slice of you right now and I think that's the reality that's it's it's sort

1562
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:20,520
of the reality the way that the Simpsons a Simpsons character is you it's like

1563
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,780
it's sort of like you and it's enough so that you can watch the story but the

1564
02:05:24,779 --> 02:05:29,488
real you man god only knows what that is and that's a union idea you know that

1565
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:34,959
the real you is something that radically transcends your perception of yourself

1566
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,230
or your conception of yourself and that you get to that higher you at least in

1567
02:05:39,229 --> 02:05:45,519
part by going into the darkest place and so it's a hell of an idea man it's

1568
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:50,380
really but it's the old idea of initiation it's as old as time that idea

1569
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,730
and and there's something to it and we definitely recreate it in psychotherapy

1570
02:05:53,729 --> 02:05:58,379
like this isn't an airy theory it's quite the contrary because what you do

1571
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:04,469
and as a psychologist always always a behaviorist say that the most the most

1572
02:06:04,469 --> 02:06:10,029
logical clinical type of psychologists a behaviorist is it an initiatory shaman

1573
02:06:10,029 --> 02:06:13,920
even though he or she doesn't know it because what they do is they say okay

1574
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,380
well let's take a look at your life like okay you got a bunch of problems and

1575
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:21,710
they're like massive dragons and you're just like you're not going anywhere with

1576
02:06:21,710 --> 02:06:26,109
those problems you're just cowering in the corner and what the behavioral

1577
02:06:26,109 --> 02:06:30,739
therapist does is cut them cut that dragon into those little Dwarfs until

1578
02:06:30,739 --> 02:06:34,399
the dwarfs are small enough so that you can really kick the hell out of them and

1579
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:37,839
so and that by the way they do that is they they take the problem and they

1580
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:43,000
decompose it into elements that are small enough that you have a reasonable

1581
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,850
probability of mastering them so you take that problem apart into into its

1582
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:53,010
micro problems careful careful process and then you think okay well how

1583
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:57,909
could we progress a little bit this week and some of that is to face to practice

1584
02:06:57,909 --> 02:07:01,779
facing things you're afraid of so like if you're a graphic and you can't get on

1585
02:07:01,779 --> 02:07:05,738
an elevator you can't get on a taxi and you can't stand up to your husband and

1586
02:07:05,738 --> 02:07:08,939
I'm saying husband because most agoraphobic sar women most of them are

1587
02:07:08,939 --> 02:07:12,750
middle-aged women and most of them were too dependent for most of their life so

1588
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:17,939
that's a monster it's like society husband elevator taxi

1589
02:07:17,939 --> 02:07:23,329
subway it's a monster and it's that place you will not go and that's because

1590
02:07:23,329 --> 02:07:27,880
you feel this high and everything else looks this big and so and partly that's

1591
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:31,340
because you've run away and when you run away from something it grows and chases

1592
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:35,529
you which is well it's exactly what happens to a prey animal man if you go

1593
02:07:35,529 --> 02:07:40,109
in the woods and you find a bear especially a grizzly well you're in real

1594
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:43,939
trouble if it's a grizzly but if it's a black bear you know generally speaking

1595
02:07:43,939 --> 02:07:47,039
if you stand your ground and make a hell of a lot of noise that thing will leave

1596
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:52,640
you alone but if you run well what's it supposed to think it eats things that

1597
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:57,550
run from it so that's exactly where that idea came to come from you turn tail and

1598
02:07:57,550 --> 02:08:01,119
run and then the thing that you're afraid of is really a monster and it's

1599
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:05,948
gonna like get you and eat you it's like well that's true psychologically as well

1600
02:08:05,948 --> 02:08:10,500
and and the same circuits that we use to when we were you know out in the forest

1601
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:15,130
even even in trees the same circuits that we used to parse up the world then

1602
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:21,100
into safe territory and place where the predators loom is the way we parse up

1603
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:25,210
the world now which is safe territory and the place where the predators loom

1604
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:30,480
it's just become abstracted way up abstracted way up so but it's the same

1605
02:08:30,479 --> 02:08:35,229
damn circuits it's we know this like the same circuits you used to forage for

1606
02:08:35,229 --> 02:08:38,069
information it's a dopaminergic circuit is the

1607
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:42,909
circuit that squirrels use to forage for nuts and you think well why well it's

1608
02:08:42,909 --> 02:08:47,409
because there's no difference between information and food like you trade

1609
02:08:47,409 --> 02:08:50,420
information for food all the time that's what you're doing when you're working

1610
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:55,340
especially if you're working on a computer so the idea that there's

1611
02:08:55,340 --> 02:09:00,250
there's an equation between information and food it's like well obviously

1612
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:04,579
obviously there's an equation between them so of course you'd use the same

1613
02:09:04,579 --> 02:09:08,470
and I mean the damn squirrel has to remember where the nuts are and so for

1614
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:12,690
him information is food even so when what happened to human beings is that we

1615
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:17,399
started thinking hey maybe it's better to go after information than it is to go

1616
02:09:17,399 --> 02:09:21,819
after food because going after information produces more food than just

1617
02:09:21,819 --> 02:09:26,090
going after food and so that was a pretty damn smart idea so we're still

1618
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:30,630
doing that so anyways this is what you're supposed to be doing and so and

1619
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:33,980
this is what behavior therapists do they decompose your problems what are you

1620
02:09:33,979 --> 02:09:38,718
afraid of well okay you're afraid of everything well let's get something

1621
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:42,220
specific you're afraid of well I'm afraid of an elevator okay an

1622
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:46,670
elevator so I have a client she's afraid of elevators the elevator door open she

1623
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:52,489
goes that's a tomb and I thought oh wow I thought it was an elevator but for you

1624
02:09:52,488 --> 02:09:56,259
it's not a bloody elevator it's death and so that's what you're

1625
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:59,539
afraid of it's worse than that you're afraid of being trapped inside there in

1626
02:09:59,539 --> 02:10:04,310
the dark alone alone not knowing if anyone is going to rescue you stuck

1627
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:09,239
there with your damn imagination freaking out it's like and if that's not

1628
02:10:09,238 --> 02:10:12,759
and then maybe you have a heart attacks because you're so terrified and you die

1629
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:16,260
it's like you know so that's the elevator

1630
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:19,340
well it's no bloody wonder there no one's gonna get into something like that

1631
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:23,670
and then maybe underneath that is your distrust in the mechanisms of society

1632
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:29,230
right because you know a normal person those weird creatures they'll get an

1633
02:10:29,229 --> 02:10:32,289
elevator what the hell they don't care and partly it's because they have an

1634
02:10:32,289 --> 02:10:36,979
implicit belief even if the thing stops somebody will come along and rescue them

1635
02:10:36,979 --> 02:10:40,399
and usually you don't even think about it right it's like no what the hell it's

1636
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:47,159
an elevator it's like the danger is invisible to you and it's partly because

1637
02:10:47,159 --> 02:10:51,698
you implicitly trust the structure and so maybe you go into the unconscious

1638
02:10:51,698 --> 02:10:55,309
presuppositions of the person who is terrified of the elevator in the subways

1639
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:58,489
and you find out they have a real problem with trusting Authority that's

1640
02:10:58,488 --> 02:11:01,238
partly why they don't get along with their husband why they've never been

1641
02:11:01,238 --> 02:11:05,519
able to stand up for themselves so then you say okay well you're afraid of the

1642
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:09,420
damn elevator but it's not an elevator it's a tomb and the tomb is partly you

1643
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:14,609
and partly it's partly the elevator and partly your unconscious mind and so well

1644
02:11:14,609 --> 02:11:17,569
what can you handle can you go look at an elevator from

1645
02:11:17,569 --> 02:11:24,659
and feet away it's like yes okay how about 9 feet away yes 5 feet yes 4 feet

1646
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:29,579
no okay no problem four and a half feet we're gonna go from that elevator we're

1647
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:33,279
gonna look at the damn thing until you're bored of it because that's what

1648
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:37,050
we're trying to you should be bored of the elevator because then you're not

1649
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:41,800
afraid of it obviously it's like it's an elevator you just don't notice it right

1650
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,529
all these things around here that you don't notice I take you out of here and

1651
02:11:45,529 --> 02:11:49,729
ask you what color the walls are you haven't got any idea you know yeah I

1652
02:11:49,729 --> 02:11:53,559
suspect for most of you there's not a chance you'd be able to identify the

1653
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:57,239
gender of the person who's sitting next to you unless you know them it's like

1654
02:11:57,238 --> 02:12:01,468
you just don't remember anything and why should you everything works like you

1655
02:12:01,469 --> 02:12:07,270
don't have to pay attention to it it's like is that staying up yeah it's still

1656
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:14,280
up yeah still up still up if it's like really no you know you get bored of that

1657
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:19,309
real quick and so then you just ignore it and but the agoraphobic has had that

1658
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:24,280
veil of ignorance torn away and what they see behind it is mortal threat and

1659
02:12:24,279 --> 02:12:28,698
so that's really what you're helping them deal with and so this week there

1660
02:12:28,698 --> 02:12:30,989
are four and a half feet from the elevator next week they're a foot from

1661
02:12:30,989 --> 02:12:35,029
the elevator and the week after that the horrible gates of Hell open and they

1662
02:12:35,029 --> 02:12:39,699
look inside and they don't run and so hey they're tougher than they thought

1663
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:42,159
they were and that's what you're teaching them actually you're not

1664
02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:45,689
teaching them that the world isn't dangerous because that's a stupid thing

1665
02:12:45,689 --> 02:12:50,139
to teach someone bloody right the world is dangerous it's terrifying and

1666
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:54,860
sometimes people under they realize that and the veil lifts and they see horror

1667
02:12:54,859 --> 02:12:58,689
everywhere they see that and then they think well I'm just a little rabbit I'm

1668
02:12:58,689 --> 02:13:03,229
over here in the corner I can't move I'm petrified and then they

1669
02:13:03,229 --> 02:13:08,169
can't move they hide it home they cower at home because everything has become a

1670
02:13:08,170 --> 02:13:13,779
predatory domain and so what you teach them is you're not as much of a rabbit

1671
02:13:13,779 --> 02:13:18,529
as you think and part of that is that you help them grow some teeth so that

1672
02:13:18,529 --> 02:13:21,369
they can go home and have that fight with their husband that they should have

1673
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:25,880
had 25 years ago and it happens very frequently with agra phobic clients that

1674
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:30,140
you get them so they can go on the damn elevator and they can go on the subway

1675
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:34,500
and they can take a taxi maybe they learn to drive Wow they get

1676
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:37,948
some autonomy and then they're a little tougher and so then they can stand up

1677
02:13:37,948 --> 02:13:41,559
from loot for themselves and they go back and like their husband might not be

1678
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:45,860
very happy with any of this really it depends on what sort of guy he is you

1679
02:13:45,859 --> 02:13:49,670
know if he's a real tyrant he might be just perfectly happy that he's married

1680
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:53,100
to someone who you know was afraid of her own shadow because then she won't

1681
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:58,760
ever leave and so that's a nasty little story and believe me it's not uncommon

1682
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:02,989
so she gets tougher by facing what she fears and what she finds out is there's

1683
02:14:02,989 --> 02:14:06,460
a hell of a lot more to her than she thought and that's really what happens

1684
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:09,859
when you do behavior therapy with someone who's agoraphobic it isn't

1685
02:14:09,859 --> 02:14:13,449
really that they get less afraid it's that they get braver that's way

1686
02:14:13,449 --> 02:14:21,300
different it's because brave is alert and able to cope naive is there's no

1687
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:25,440
danger it's like hell yeah right there's no danger Jesus what a stupid theory

1688
02:14:25,439 --> 02:14:30,379
that is so anyways that's what all this is that's that's the story man and it's

1689
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:37,420
a it's a major story it's the story of human transformation and growth it's the

1690
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:41,510
evolution of mankind it's like it's a major story and we've been working on

1691
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:48,900
the damn thing for like god only knows how long you know snakes and primates

1692
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:54,130
co-evolved and our vision are sharp sharp sharp vision seems to have been an

1693
02:14:54,131 --> 02:15:00,530
evolutionary adaptation forced on us by the presence of predatory snakes and

1694
02:15:00,529 --> 02:15:04,949
we're talking tens of millions of years ago and human beings have unbelievably

1695
02:15:04,949 --> 02:15:09,359
sharp eyesight the only thing that can out see us is birds of prey and they

1696
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:13,569
have eyes like an eagle a bald eagle has eyes as big as ours and it has two

1697
02:15:13,569 --> 02:15:18,139
phobias that phobia is the central part of the vision so an eagle is all eyes

1698
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:22,340
man and so but human beings we're kind of like that too and like half our brain

1699
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:27,630
is devoted to visual processing we have acute vision in Madagascar where there

1700
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:31,090
are primates with no predatory snakes there are lemurs they can't see worth a

1701
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:35,670
damn and I'm a anthropologist named Lynn Isabelle did a comprehensive study

1702
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:39,020
worldwide trying to account for the acuity of primate vision and what she

1703
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:43,460
found was that the more predatory snakes in the vicinity the sharper the eyesight

1704
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:47,529
of the primates and so we have a really sharp eyesight

1705
02:15:47,529 --> 02:15:51,199
so that means a lot of us were eaten by snakes and none of your ancestors

1706
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:54,769
fortunately because otherwise you wouldn't be here but a lot of those who

1707
02:15:54,770 --> 02:16:01,199
fell by the wayside were snake snack and you know when you're little and living

1708
02:16:01,198 --> 02:16:05,279
in a tree a snake is no damn joke and even now lots of people get bitten by

1709
02:16:05,279 --> 02:16:09,979
snakes and people are phobic of snakes at quite a rate and some of that

1710
02:16:09,979 --> 02:16:14,029
actually seems innate there's arguments about cycle between psychologists about

1711
02:16:14,029 --> 02:16:17,729
this but even the ones who don't accept the fact that it's innate accept the

1712
02:16:17,729 --> 02:16:22,829
fact that you can make someone afraid of a snake by conditioning just like that

1713
02:16:22,829 --> 02:16:26,238
we're trying to make them afraid of a flower by conditioning is really really

1714
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:32,398
hard so we're at least at minimum prepared to be afraid of snakes minimum

1715
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:36,108
and I believe it's I don't I believe this fear is actually an 8 although you

1716
02:16:36,109 --> 02:16:40,929
can learn to control it so anyways so that's that story and like

1717
02:16:40,929 --> 02:16:46,668
what a story man it's an amazing amazing story you see the the den of the dragon

1718
02:16:46,668 --> 02:16:50,019
here is littered with skulls and bones that's what that is so either thing is

1719
02:16:50,019 --> 02:16:54,550
no joke it's like look the hell out and that's this you know and look it up at

1720
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:59,599
the top right hand corner there you know that's from Peter Pan right well you

1721
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:03,270
remember Captain Hook we talked about him already he's a tyrant and he's a

1722
02:17:03,270 --> 02:17:07,710
tyrant because he's afraid of death and that's all he sees in life and so it

1723
02:17:07,709 --> 02:17:11,488
makes him cruel and better and death has already taken part of him right that's

1724
02:17:11,488 --> 02:17:15,558
why he has a hook and that damn crocodiles chasing him tick tick all the

1725
02:17:15,558 --> 02:17:19,958
time and of course that's the same situation you're all in man there was a

1726
02:17:19,959 --> 02:17:23,989
crocodile with a clock at its stomach chasing you and it could easily turn you

1727
02:17:23,988 --> 02:17:28,500
into a tyrant it can turn you into a tyrant or a cowering victim or a hero

1728
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:33,629
those are the options fundamentally so and that's the Gorgon looking at her own

1729
02:17:33,629 --> 02:17:37,268
the Medusa looking at her own reflection you know mother nature with a head full

1730
02:17:37,269 --> 02:17:41,079
of snakes you know a terrifying vision and that's actually to some degree an

1731
02:17:41,079 --> 02:17:45,138
archetype that men get confused with women and you know that's the witchy

1732
02:17:45,138 --> 02:17:49,078
part of women and that's the part that's attractive attractive attractive but

1733
02:17:49,078 --> 02:17:54,488
rejecting rejecting rejecting it so many men are petrified by women they won't

1734
02:17:54,488 --> 02:17:57,529
approach them at all they have no idea how to talk to them they're just

1735
02:17:57,529 --> 02:18:01,449
petrified into and that's way more common than you

1736
02:18:01,449 --> 02:18:06,168
think and so that breeds resentment like you wouldn't believe you know you hear

1737
02:18:06,168 --> 02:18:10,398
the guy who shot up like Dawson College it's like what the hell do you think

1738
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:16,599
motivated him it's like he that's what he saw and and it was because well he

1739
02:18:16,599 --> 02:18:20,920
was my opinion is he was too goddamn useless to be attractive to anyone and

1740
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:25,388
so that's a hell of a place to be in you know it's then that's the problem

1741
02:18:25,388 --> 02:18:28,920
too if you're chronically rejected by people it's often because of your own

1742
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:33,318
insufficiencies you know whether that's cowardice or lack of social skills or

1743
02:18:33,318 --> 02:18:37,319
whatever it is it's like you can't just brush it off as oh well you know no one

1744
02:18:37,319 --> 02:18:43,478
likes me but really I'm okay it's like no no wrong if everyone rejects you

1745
02:18:43,478 --> 02:18:46,988
there's probably something wrong and it's probably deep and difficult and

1746
02:18:46,988 --> 02:18:52,049
it's going to be horrible to fix and so it's this isn't a trivial problem it's

1747
02:18:52,049 --> 02:18:56,728
not a trivial problem at all and so you know that's mother nature for man too

1748
02:18:56,728 --> 02:19:01,209
because from from the sexual selection point of view if they if they're not

1749
02:19:01,209 --> 02:19:09,079
selected as a mate Nature has taken them out of the game right and so you know

1750
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:12,299
people don't really like that they're not that happy with that and so but

1751
02:19:12,299 --> 02:19:15,808
getting all whiny about it and then getting violent it's like that's just

1752
02:19:15,808 --> 02:19:22,170
not all not really very helpful although it's very common so this is Lyndon

1753
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:26,138
Isabel an evolutionary arms race between early snakes and mammals triggered the

1754
02:19:26,138 --> 02:19:30,278
development of improved vision and large brain in primates a radical new theory

1755
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:35,569
suggests these are old representations I really like this one this is I don't

1756
02:19:35,568 --> 02:19:38,478
remember I think it's Greek but it doesn't

1757
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:42,318
exactly look Greek it might be older it doesn't matter anyways you see it's

1758
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:46,988
the same thing same ideas as Graham's dream right it's like there's this thing

1759
02:19:46,988 --> 02:19:51,228
that exists this this multi headed snake and it's got this infinity problem it's

1760
02:19:51,228 --> 02:19:55,568
everywhere that's that little circle down there and the problem is well what

1761
02:19:55,568 --> 02:19:58,898
do you do with it you cut off one head seven more growth that's the eternal

1762
02:19:58,898 --> 02:20:05,238
problem of life and the problem is there there there is the category of problems

1763
02:20:05,238 --> 02:20:10,208
in life and it ain't going anywhere and so the question is can you deal with the

1764
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:15,090
whole category at the same time that's the thing that's how to be in the

1765
02:20:15,090 --> 02:20:19,238
world is to deal with that category all at the same time and so how did how did

1766
02:20:19,238 --> 02:20:23,359
human beings what did they come up with as a solution and that's so cool too

1767
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:27,040
because the solution they come up with not only was the heroism that allows you

1768
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:31,060
to approach what you're terrified by and what you find offensive and to learn

1769
02:20:31,059 --> 02:20:35,618
from it but also the idea of sacrifice and and that was played out by cultures

1770
02:20:35,619 --> 02:20:39,390
everywhere including human sacrifice and you think what the hell was up with

1771
02:20:39,389 --> 02:20:43,469
those crazy bastards so long ago they were sacrificing two gods all the time

1772
02:20:43,469 --> 02:20:48,748
what kind of clueless behavior was that burned something and please God burn

1773
02:20:48,748 --> 02:20:53,478
something valuable and please God it's like what was with them what were they

1774
02:20:53,478 --> 02:20:58,389
thinking well they weren't stupid those people if they were stupid we wouldn't

1775
02:20:58,389 --> 02:21:02,099
be here they were not stupid and believe me they lived under a lot harsher

1776
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:07,250
conditions than we do so those were some tough people man you know back then

1777
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:11,590
you'd last about 15 minutes and so you don't want to be thinking of your

1778
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:15,439
ancestors as stupid like there's no real evidence that we're much different

1779
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:18,430
cognitively than we were a hundred and fifty thousand years ago

1780
02:21:18,430 --> 02:21:25,229
so anyways sacrifice what does that mean sacrifice well it's a discovery man it's

1781
02:21:25,228 --> 02:21:29,879
the discovery of the future it's like the future is actually the place where

1782
02:21:29,879 --> 02:21:33,969
there is threat and it's always gonna be there so what do you do you make

1783
02:21:33,969 --> 02:21:40,289
sacrifices in the present so that the future is better right everyone does

1784
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:43,149
that that's what you're doing right now that's what you're doing here that's

1785
02:21:43,148 --> 02:21:46,260
what your parents are doing when they pay money to send you to university they

1786
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:52,389
think you can bargain with reality it's amazing you can bargain with reality you

1787
02:21:52,389 --> 02:21:59,389
can forestall gratification now and it'll pay off it at a place in time that

1788
02:21:59,389 --> 02:22:04,139
doesn't even exist yet it's like who would have believed that it's like

1789
02:22:04,139 --> 02:22:07,568
that's a miracle that that occurs and it's not like people just figured that

1790
02:22:07,568 --> 02:22:12,010
overnight you know we were chimps for Christ's sake like how are we gonna come

1791
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:15,898
up with an idea like that well it's like well we thought about it for seven

1792
02:22:15,898 --> 02:22:20,948
million years and you know we got to the point where we could kind of act it out

1793
02:22:20,949 --> 02:22:25,319
but we didn't know what we were doing but it was a merge it's like a dream it

1794
02:22:25,318 --> 02:22:28,760
was so the terror of the future is a dream

1795
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:32,850
and the solution to the terror the dream of the terror of the future is another

1796
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:38,470
dream and and it comes out in mythology and in fantasy and in drama where you

1797
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:43,529
act out the sacrifice and then it's a step on the way to full understanding so

1798
02:22:43,529 --> 02:22:47,450
we can say sacrifice now instead of doing it you know although we still do

1799
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:53,200
it it's just not concretize like it used to be we do it abstractly and we all

1800
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:57,819
have faith that it will work you know and we also set up our society so that

1801
02:22:57,818 --> 02:23:03,948
it'll work and one thing about you know I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a

1802
02:23:03,949 --> 02:23:07,619
variety of reasons partly because I think it's an it's an extreme form of

1803
02:23:07,619 --> 02:23:13,699
cowardice but anyways apart from that no no no no there's minimal ways that you

1804
02:23:13,699 --> 02:23:18,439
can set up a society that will work and so one of them is is that the society

1805
02:23:18,439 --> 02:23:23,488
has to be set up so that your sacrifices will pay off or you won't work and then

1806
02:23:23,488 --> 02:23:27,658
the society will die and so it has to make promises people have to make

1807
02:23:27,658 --> 02:23:32,788
promises to one another and that's what money is money is a promise that your

1808
02:23:32,789 --> 02:23:36,689
sacrifice will pay off in the future that's what money is and so if the

1809
02:23:36,689 --> 02:23:42,889
society is stable you can store up your work right now you can sacrifice your

1810
02:23:42,889 --> 02:23:48,689
impulses and you can work and you can store up credit for the future and then

1811
02:23:48,689 --> 02:23:52,420
you can make the future a better place but Society has to be stable enough to

1812
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:57,930
allow for that hyperinflation will do you in so the promise that's implicit in

1813
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:01,619
the currency is the promise that what you're doing now will pay off in the

1814
02:24:01,619 --> 02:24:06,189
future and if people don't have that promise then well we know what they do

1815
02:24:06,189 --> 02:24:11,220
because in in gangs for example and say gangs in North America the time horizon

1816
02:24:11,219 --> 02:24:14,068
of the gang members shrinks rapidly because they don't really expect to be

1817
02:24:14,068 --> 02:24:18,519
alive at much past 21 and so they get really impulsive and violent and like

1818
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:23,590
why the hell not that's that's what you do when when the future doesn't matter

1819
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:27,918
when it's not real you you default back to living in the moment and you take

1820
02:24:27,918 --> 02:24:31,299
what you can get right now and no wonder because you don't know if you're gonna

1821
02:24:31,299 --> 02:24:36,198
be around you know in a year and you get whatever you can well you can bloody

1822
02:24:36,199 --> 02:24:39,659
well get it and that's like anarchy that state and so

1823
02:24:39,659 --> 02:24:42,109
you don't want to live and some people like to live in that state because

1824
02:24:42,109 --> 02:24:45,979
they're really wired for that you know and so they're they're much more

1825
02:24:45,978 --> 02:24:50,648
comfortable in those conditions there they're kind of like warrior types I

1826
02:24:50,648 --> 02:24:56,139
would say in some sense but you know for most people that's just where that

1827
02:24:56,139 --> 02:25:03,769
stress will just do you in you know the stress of a life like that so that's a

1828
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:07,209
pretty horrible picture the one on the right I think and you know it's it's a

1829
02:25:07,209 --> 02:25:10,789
creepy picture and don't you think doesn't it seems like a creepy picture

1830
02:25:10,789 --> 02:25:15,760
to me yeah and so that's quetzel a codel if I remember correctly who's me who is

1831
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:21,309
an Aztec dragon God and that's the Eye of Horus by oh by the way this little

1832
02:25:21,309 --> 02:25:25,189
thing here and that see the Egyptians they worship the eye

1833
02:25:25,189 --> 02:25:30,318
yeah well that's cool because well why did they worship the eye well wake the

1834
02:25:30,318 --> 02:25:33,988
hell up and look at the world that's your salvation to do that pay bloody

1835
02:25:33,988 --> 02:25:37,920
attention especially to the things you don't want to pay attention to and use

1836
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:43,510
your vision have some vision and you can use your vision to see into the future

1837
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:48,079
and that is your that's your Redemption and the Egyptians they didn't know how

1838
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:52,068
to say that but they knew how to represent it and that's how they

1839
02:25:52,068 --> 02:25:56,578
represented it like the pupil on that is completely open completely dilated and

1840
02:25:56,578 --> 02:26:00,059
that's a God as far as the Egyptians we're concerned it's Horus and I'll tell

1841
02:26:00,059 --> 02:26:04,568
you Horus a story at some point so early primates developed a better eye for

1842
02:26:04,568 --> 02:26:08,090
color detail and movement and the ability to see in three dimensions

1843
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:11,109
traits that are important for detecting threats at close range humans are

1844
02:26:11,109 --> 02:26:15,559
descended from these same primates all right

1845
02:26:15,559 --> 02:26:21,090
so now the initiation when you go into psychotherapy or when you make any

1846
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:26,449
supreme moral effort which is roughly the same thing you have to confront that

1847
02:26:26,449 --> 02:26:31,418
which you do not know now I mentioned the called prima cosmogonic chaos and

1848
02:26:31,418 --> 02:26:34,738
the idea that at the end of Jung's life he sort of thought of the unconscious

1849
02:26:34,738 --> 02:26:38,158
and the world as the same and you think what the hell does that mean but here's

1850
02:26:38,158 --> 02:26:42,129
what it means so let's say you're in a long-term intimate relationship and you

1851
02:26:42,129 --> 02:26:48,738
get betrayed okay so what is it that you see when you see your partner at the

1852
02:26:48,738 --> 02:26:53,238
moment you know of the betrayal well you see the pre

1853
02:26:53,238 --> 02:26:59,930
maganda chaos and here's why well it rattles your unconscious up because you

1854
02:26:59,930 --> 02:27:03,950
don't know anything anymore you don't know what the past was right you don't

1855
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:07,310
know what it was and it's supposed to be real and all of a sudden you don't know

1856
02:27:07,309 --> 02:27:11,918
what it was and so you come up with wild ideas about what it might have been and

1857
02:27:11,918 --> 02:27:15,299
what it represented and then you don't know what the future is gonna be anymore

1858
02:27:15,299 --> 02:27:18,528
so then your fantasy fills that space and you don't know who the hell you're

1859
02:27:18,529 --> 02:27:22,560
looking at that's for sure and you don't know much about human beings and you

1860
02:27:22,559 --> 02:27:25,129
certainly don't know anything about yourself

1861
02:27:25,129 --> 02:27:29,498
and so all of a sudden not only is everything in chaos inside your mind but

1862
02:27:29,498 --> 02:27:33,629
everything is in chaos in your world and it actually is and

1863
02:27:33,629 --> 02:27:36,698
there's no telling the difference between those two things you know and so

1864
02:27:36,699 --> 02:27:41,560
then they you're just shattered and so then you go talk to a therapist for like

1865
02:27:41,559 --> 02:27:47,260
two years and you think what happened what was the reality and the reality is

1866
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:51,200
because who knows what the reality was like but as far as you're concerned the

1867
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:56,470
reality is I better represent this properly in my head I better figure out

1868
02:27:56,469 --> 02:28:01,668
who I was who that person was what we did together and what it meant because I

1869
02:28:01,668 --> 02:28:07,039
do not want this to happen again and so you're healed

1870
02:28:07,039 --> 02:28:11,800
when you get to the point where you've grasped the bloody moral of the story

1871
02:28:11,799 --> 02:28:16,019
what went wrong and how can I not have that happen again

1872
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:20,020
because that's the purpose of learning right that's the purpose of memory it's

1873
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:26,449
to prepare you for the future and so you have to pull out of that massive chaos a

1874
02:28:26,449 --> 02:28:31,340
functional representation that increases your wisdom so that you're not this

1875
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:35,478
naive target the next time you enter into a relationship so at least you can

1876
02:28:35,478 --> 02:28:40,349
have another relationship without being so traumatized that you know you you're

1877
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:45,149
done and you know it can take people years to talk that through because this

1878
02:28:45,148 --> 02:28:49,778
landscape of potential opens up when when they're betrayed it's like well

1879
02:28:49,779 --> 02:28:55,029
anything could have been the truth well you to sort through that you have to

1880
02:28:55,029 --> 02:28:59,709
wander through all that mess and it's really painful and and emotional as well

1881
02:28:59,709 --> 02:29:04,729
you have to sort through all that mess to come out with the new you right there

1882
02:29:04,728 --> 02:29:10,438
renewed you and so well this is a representation of it this

1883
02:29:10,439 --> 02:29:14,930
is how people act this out by but whatever method he may have been

1884
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:19,568
designated the shaman is recognized as such as only after having received two

1885
02:29:19,568 --> 02:29:24,228
methods of instruction the first is ecstatic dreams trances and visions the

1886
02:29:24,228 --> 02:29:27,938
second is traditional shamanic techniques names and functions of the

1887
02:29:27,939 --> 02:29:32,300
spirit mythology and genealogy of the clan and the secret language well one of

1888
02:29:32,299 --> 02:29:36,328
the things that happens this happens to you even if if you encounter something

1889
02:29:36,328 --> 02:29:41,020
terrible like a betrayal what happens is that you have to take a journey into the

1890
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:46,551
domain of morality essentially which is how did I act and how did that person to

1891
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:49,998
act and how should have they acted and how should have I acted and so and

1892
02:29:49,998 --> 02:29:54,059
that's part of your cultural structure and so that's the idea of rescuing the

1893
02:29:54,059 --> 02:29:57,760
dead farther from the depths right and that's what we'll show you some examples

1894
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:05,619
of that so this is a critical issue with regards to the shamanic transformation

1895
02:30:05,619 --> 02:30:10,479
is that people go through these terrible terrible experiences often drug-induced

1896
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:13,738
by the way with regards to the shaman they usually use psychedelic chemicals

1897
02:30:13,738 --> 02:30:17,299
of one form another often mushrooms but but they've come up with some very

1898
02:30:17,299 --> 02:30:22,250
strange concoctions like ayahuasca down in the Amazon and ayahuasca is an

1899
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:27,020
amazing substance it's made out of the bark of one thing and another plant

1900
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:30,859
whose name I don't remember that hardly even grow in the same place and that

1901
02:30:30,859 --> 02:30:35,899
have to be cooked together in a special way and no one has any idea how the damn

1902
02:30:35,898 --> 02:30:39,680
Amazonians figured that out it looks impossible and if you ask them they say

1903
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:43,540
well the plants told us how to do it which you know Western people don't find

1904
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:47,529
very helpful but the shamans are perfectly helped happy with that that

1905
02:30:47,529 --> 02:30:51,310
description in ayahuasca takes them apart and it does that in part because

1906
02:30:51,309 --> 02:30:56,949
its effects the serotonergic system very very powerfully like all psychedelics do

1907
02:30:56,950 --> 02:31:02,489
and it transports them to another world and that's how they interpret it and and

1908
02:31:02,488 --> 02:31:07,010
and and what we know about psychedelics you could put in a thimble and then

1909
02:31:07,010 --> 02:31:11,189
throw the thimble away we know nothing about psychedelics there's new

1910
02:31:11,189 --> 02:31:15,770
experiments going on at Johns Hopkins for example with psilocybin which is

1911
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:19,800
part of this active chemical in magic mushrooms same structure basically as

1912
02:31:19,799 --> 02:31:22,898
LSD and mescaline all the real psychedelics have basically

1913
02:31:22,898 --> 02:31:27,068
the same structure except the one that's derived from Amanita muscaria which is

1914
02:31:27,068 --> 02:31:30,748
called muscarinic acid and it's a it's its own weird thing that no one knows

1915
02:31:30,748 --> 02:31:34,578
anything about anyways they have profound neuro chemical effects in very

1916
02:31:34,578 --> 02:31:40,788
small doses and the research group at Johns Hopkins has given psilocybin to

1917
02:31:40,789 --> 02:31:43,588
research subjects you know purified psilocybin because

1918
02:31:43,588 --> 02:31:47,238
they started the new experimentation with psychedelics and that's been banned

1919
02:31:47,238 --> 02:31:50,469
for like 40 years because psychedelics were so terrifying

1920
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:53,998
to our culture that we just put them away it's like oh no we're not going

1921
02:31:53,998 --> 02:31:58,439
there and so even from a research perspective and even though some of the

1922
02:31:58,439 --> 02:32:02,529
psychedelics look very promising for the treatment of disorders like alcoholism

1923
02:32:02,529 --> 02:32:06,039
they recently used psilocybin to help people stop smoking down at Johns

1924
02:32:06,039 --> 02:32:10,270
Hopkins and I think they had an 80% success rate which is just like that's

1925
02:32:10,270 --> 02:32:14,279
just absolutely mind-boggling and so but if you give people psilocybin

1926
02:32:14,279 --> 02:32:17,970
and they have a mystical experience which is very common among people who

1927
02:32:17,969 --> 02:32:23,318
take these sorts of chemicals then their personality transforms permanently such

1928
02:32:23,318 --> 02:32:27,859
that one year later their one standard deviation higher in openness and

1929
02:32:27,859 --> 02:32:31,609
openness is the creativity dimension and that seems to be a permanent

1930
02:32:31,609 --> 02:32:35,290
transformation so that's really remarkable and about 80 percent of the

1931
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:39,979
people who undergo the Johns Hopkins experiments report that the experience

1932
02:32:39,978 --> 02:32:43,719
is like one of the two or three most important things they've ever that's

1933
02:32:43,719 --> 02:32:48,679
never ever happened to them and so well that's that's something you know it's

1934
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:52,510
like and then there's this guy named Rick Strassman down at I think he was at

1935
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:56,369
the University of Texas and he did experimentation with DMT and DMT

1936
02:32:56,369 --> 02:33:01,729
dimethyltryptamine I remember I remember correctly is the active ingredient in

1937
02:33:01,728 --> 02:33:05,349
ayahuasca and you produce it in your brain and it's in plants it's like a

1938
02:33:05,350 --> 02:33:10,050
very common chemical but DMT is a weird hallucinogen because it has an

1939
02:33:10,049 --> 02:33:14,358
extraordinarily short mechanism of action it's like and people who take it

1940
02:33:14,359 --> 02:33:19,609
report that they're blasted out of their body like out of a cannon and then they

1941
02:33:19,609 --> 02:33:25,850
go out somewhere and encounter beings of various sorts and then ten minutes later

1942
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:29,899
they're back and virtually everyone reports that which is really strange and

1943
02:33:29,898 --> 02:33:34,668
and so strassman was giving people DMT intravenously so that the trip

1944
02:33:34,668 --> 02:33:39,619
would last longer he this was all all you know nih-funded

1945
02:33:39,619 --> 02:33:42,418
experimentation all cleared with the relevant ethics boards all conducted

1946
02:33:42,418 --> 02:33:46,629
within the last 10 years and he basically quit doing it because he was a

1947
02:33:46,629 --> 02:33:50,019
pretty straight scientist you know he was measuring heart rate and pulse and

1948
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:53,748
all that sort of thing trying to look at the physiology and then the people he

1949
02:33:53,748 --> 02:33:57,708
was giving these chemicals to kept coming back and telling him these these

1950
02:33:57,709 --> 02:34:04,659
crazy stories and well it just it was too much for him you know and no wonder

1951
02:34:04,658 --> 02:34:07,680
you know cuz they all said the same thing and he'd say well that was a dream

1952
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,398
and they'd say no and it was the most real thing that ever happened to me and

1953
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:14,049
he'd say well you know it's an archetypal experience and they'd say no

1954
02:34:14,049 --> 02:34:17,670
no no that was no archetypal experience I went somewhere else and I saw things

1955
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:21,488
and I'm back and like I don't care what you think and like who the hell knows

1956
02:34:21,488 --> 02:34:25,279
right because it's all subjective but but the weird thing about it is that

1957
02:34:25,279 --> 02:34:29,350
everyone's reporting the same thing how the hell do you account for that and

1958
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:32,529
then the shaman you know when they take these psychedelic chemicals they

1959
02:34:32,529 --> 02:34:36,630
basically say the same thing they say well first of all it more or less killed

1960
02:34:36,629 --> 02:34:43,958
me that's this you know i dissolved two skeleton and then I climbed the tree

1961
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:47,760
that unites heaven and earth and I went into the realm of the gods and they gave

1962
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:52,380
me some information and I'm back it's like okay well you know we don't really

1963
02:34:52,379 --> 02:34:56,089
know what to make of that and we and certainly that's what Elia describes

1964
02:34:56,090 --> 02:35:00,180
when he describes the shamanic the shamanic procession not the shamanic

1965
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:04,270
initiation and you know there's dissolution to a skeleton first and then

1966
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:08,630
like a death the symbolic death or experienced as an actual death and then

1967
02:35:08,629 --> 02:35:13,849
bang up into the realm of the gods and then they come back there's a very old

1968
02:35:13,850 --> 02:35:17,479
idea and that's a medieval representation of the tunnel that people

1969
02:35:17,478 --> 02:35:21,260
travel through at the end of their life to you know to find the light which is a

1970
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:25,158
very common near-death experience report and people don't have any idea what the

1971
02:35:25,158 --> 02:35:29,389
hell to do with those reports except say well it's the paroxysm zuv the dying

1972
02:35:29,389 --> 02:35:34,278
brain which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more random in my opinion and the

1973
02:35:34,279 --> 02:35:39,529
idea is there's a rebirth after that and you know here this is the Scandinavian

1974
02:35:39,529 --> 02:35:43,918
representation of that tree that unites earth with heaven and so there's the

1975
02:35:43,918 --> 02:35:48,200
Scandinavian representation it has a snake snakes down here eating it and

1976
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:53,649
and that's the amazonian representation it's like how the hell he account for

1977
02:35:53,648 --> 02:35:58,549
that I mean those those pictures are so similar that it's just it's beyond

1978
02:35:58,549 --> 02:36:05,259
belief well you know we lived in trees for a long time a long long long long

1979
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:10,029
time millions of years and there were lots of snakes around them and so the

1980
02:36:10,029 --> 02:36:14,189
idea that reality is a tree that's surrounded by a snake is that's in us

1981
02:36:14,189 --> 02:36:18,068
man it's down there it's deep and there's something about it that's true

1982
02:36:18,068 --> 02:36:23,028
now not true like we normally think of truth a truth true in an entirely

1983
02:36:23,029 --> 02:36:28,449
different manner so and all that's pretty damn strange we'll stop with this

1984
02:36:28,449 --> 02:36:32,899
my son drew this when he was seven years old blew me away man I thought it was so

1985
02:36:32,898 --> 02:36:37,448
cool so I had it laminated and so here is what it is on the right hand side

1986
02:36:37,449 --> 02:36:42,810
that's ordered it's like the yin-yang thing that's order left-side chaos right

1987
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:47,689
and those are all mushroom houses which I thought was amazing and then there's

1988
02:36:47,689 --> 02:36:51,630
this river that runs right down the middle like the line for order and chaos

1989
02:36:51,629 --> 02:36:55,488
and then there's this tree that goes up to heaven and that's heaven up there

1990
02:36:55,488 --> 02:36:58,948
it's like there st. Peter there's the pearly gates there's the clouds it's

1991
02:36:58,949 --> 02:37:03,789
like it's he never went to church you know it's like what the hell and then

1992
02:37:03,789 --> 02:37:08,369
there's a little bug there that goes up and down from heaven to earth and that

1993
02:37:08,369 --> 02:37:13,199
was him and I thought he had a very organized psyche that kid he was a very

1994
02:37:13,199 --> 02:37:17,658
very stable kid and still is and I he drew that and I thought Jesus that's

1995
02:37:17,658 --> 02:37:22,189
just bloody will unbelievable and I still think that when I look at it and

1996
02:37:22,189 --> 02:37:26,939
that's a great example of an archetype and so we'll see you Tuesday

1997
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:27,119
you

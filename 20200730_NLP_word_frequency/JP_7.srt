1
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:12,058
So on to Sigmund Freud

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,940
We're going to give him somewhat short shrift. I'm afraid because we only have an hour to talk about Freud, but that's okay

3
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,609
We could get a fair way through it

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:28,198
He's still persona non grata, I would say among experimental psychologists and probably clinical psychologists as well

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,108
But that seems to me to be very unfair

6
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:34,618
Freud Freud is one of those thinkers who?

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,770
All that's left are his mistakes

8
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,738
and the reason for that is that everything that he

9
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:48,509
Discovered or put forward is so entrenched in our culture now that we think it's self-evident and so everything

10
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,359
correct has been assimilated and that just leaves everything that's more or less floating on top to look wrong and

11
00:00:54,698 --> 00:01:01,439
But Freud is also one of those thinkers who was always wrong in an interesting way and that's very useful. And so I

12
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:05,608
also think that many of the things that he put his finger on that are of

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,729
still disputed for example, the idea of the Oedipus complex are much more useful than people are willing to

14
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,350
admit

15
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:19,798
especially in the clinical realm because the eatable complex which we'll talk about quite a bit is actually a

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
description of a fairly

17
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,079
stable

18
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,649
form of familial psychopathology where

19
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:36,959
child gets trapped within the confines of a family because the relationship with one parent or the other or both is so tight that

20
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,638
they can't break beyond it and maybe because of their own inability to

21
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,408
move towards independence but more frequently because of

22
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,978
What you might describe as a kind of conspiracy between the son and and the parent or the child and the parent

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
that prevents them from

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,930
moving towards

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,989
Autonomous life and keeps them in a state of essentially a state of childhood dependence

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,588
Freud said I started my professional activity as a neurologist trying to bring relief to my neurotic patients under the influence of an older friend

27
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:18,530
And by my own efforts, I discovered some important new facts about the unconscious and psychic life

28
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,468
The role of instinctual urges and so on out of these findings grew a new science psychoanalysis

29
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,799
A part of psychology and a new treatment for the neurosis. I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck

30
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,819
People did not believe in my facts and thought my theories unsavory

31
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,388
Resistance was strong and unrelenting in the end

32
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,500
I succeeded in inquiring pupils and building it up in international psychoanalytic Association

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,269
But the struggle is not over he made that recording just shortly before he died. He moved to to England to escape the Nazis

34
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,919
Before Freud I guess

35
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,519
The mind was

36
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,778
It's complicated because Freud of course was not the only person to be thinking along the lines that he thought Pierre

37
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,199
jennae

38
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:13,129
who was one of his teachers had originated and started to develop many of the ideas that I would say were popularized by Freud but

39
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,868
The idea of the unconscious mind was not

40
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,409
Certainly not as well developed

41
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,099
prior to Freud as it became afterwards and

42
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,909
Before that I suppose

43
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,340
You might say that insofar as people thought of the mind at all

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,989
They thought of in philosophical terms and the mind would be that part of you

45
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,989
That's that you're aware of like in the dark in

46
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,628
The Cartesian sense Descartes said I think therefore I am and it kind of seems in some sense

47
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,269
Self-evident that you're aware of and have control over the contents of your own mind

48
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,009
But that was what Freud really questioned and he questioned it deeply said well

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,700
first of all the idea that you're one thing like one mind is a dubious idea to begin with because

50
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:11,149
People are full of internal contradictions. And then the idea that your mind is all of one type

51
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:18,409
it's it's all of one form was also very questionable as far as Freud was concerned because you could be fractionated into

52
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,459
subcomponents and

53
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,348
You know the idea for example that your anger or your sexual desire could be an autonomous part of your personality in some sense

54
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,669
It could overtake you and control you. That's really a Freudian idea and

55
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,759
one of the classic Freudian ideas really is that people are made out of sub personalities and

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,660
Those sub personalities are alive. And that's one of the things I really like about the psychoanalytic thinkers because even the

57
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:49,248
Psychologists who say over the last thirty years are they're about

58
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,918
Since maybe longer now

59
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,719
anyways, since the demise of behaviorism as an ideology and

60
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:00,618
the admission by psychologists that there were

61
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,528
There is an active unconscious or many active unconscious which is a better way of thinking about it

62
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,709
Psychologists still really haven't come to terms with the idea in any deep sense that these unconscious

63
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,709
Processes are living things, you know there

64
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,749
When psychologists talk for example about the cognitive unconscious they're talking about something that that they describe it more machine-like

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,049
with more machine like metaphors and that's not reasonable you you understand things a lot better if you

66
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,259
understand that the sub components that make up people the fragmentary bits of them and also the biological

67
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,099
subsystems that that are part and parcel of your being are

68
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,879
Much more intelligently viewed as personalities there

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,780
there are kind of uni dimensional personalities in some sense so that for example, if you're angry you're nothing, but angry I mean

70
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:56,868
That's an overstatement obviously or if you're afraid you're nothing but afraid or if you're hungry you're nothing but hunger well

71
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,530
That's certainly true

72
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,359
If you get hungry enough or thirsty

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Or too hot or any of those things you you kind of collapsed to a simpler personality. That only has one

74
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,338
Motivation in mind and we'll talk a lot as we progress about the grounding of those uni-dimensional

75
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,840
Motivational systems in biology, but I'd have to say that Freud was

76
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,288
among the first at least the first to

77
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,750
Synthesize a coherent theory of this multiplicity and to put it forth

78
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,748
while also insisting that much of what was happening to you and inside of you was

79
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,099
not

80
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
immediately accessible

81
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,168
To your awareness and it's a very profound. It's a very profound discovery

82
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,339
it means among any among many other things that you

83
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,038
can formulate ideas

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,858
First of all, it means that you can act out things

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,239
That you don't understand for reasons that you don't understand it

86
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,918
also means that

87
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,308
Your memory can contain things that's represented in one way, but that can't be understood in another

88
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:08,088
So for example, and we know this is true because there are independent memory systems. There's an independent memory system for procedures

89
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,698
That's for actions. There's an independent

90
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:19,158
memory system for what you might describe as imagination for for the memory that uses images and then there's a another system that

91
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:26,598
articulates knowledge that's the semantic memory system and it's not obvious at all that the contents of all of those are

92
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,359
equivalent and that's why for example

93
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:36,529
you can dream things that you don't know because one of the things you might think is that your dreams watch you act and they

94
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:41,779
Watch other people act and then they make a little drama out of that and that drama has information in it

95
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,488
But you don't necessarily know what that information is in that you can't describe it consciously

96
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,168
Right. It's it's akin to the PA Chetty an idea. That kids can play a game

97
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:56,838
and you can take them away from the game and then they won't know how to describe the rules even though they can play the

98
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,379
Game and so dreams can contain information. That's full of

99
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:06,678
the encoding of behavior that has information in it that you're not consciously aware of and so then you can become

100
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,709
consciously aware of that in a kind of a revelation side

101
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:14,778
Maybe that's what you do when you become aware of the meaning of a dream or the meaning of a fantasy or something like that

102
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:15,899
and

103
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,918
That's all all our ability to think that way in some ways can be traced back to Freud

104
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,359
Now Freud concentrated mostly I would say at least in terms of pathology on

105
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,259
sexual and aggressive

106
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,048
Impulses and I I don't think that there's any mystery for modern people

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,149
about why aggressive impulses might be particularly difficult to integrate into the personality and might remain underdeveloped or will say

108
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,269
repressed although those aren't the same thing and

109
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,859
I think in order to you might think that in different times in society

110
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,129
Some things are allowed to surface express themselves and other things are less allowed. And so

111
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,129
Victorian times had a number of

112
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,850
characteristics that made the repression of sexuality particularly likely and perhaps also the repression of aggression and we're talking about

113
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,690
Victorian times in in Europe, obviously and only one time in one place

114
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,298
As Henry or Ellen Burgess says this is a great book by the way

115
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:19,759
the discovery of the unconscious if you're interested in

116
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,159
If you're really interested in psychoanalytic ideas Freud Jung and Adler and also the history of those ideas

117
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:31,460
There's no better book than the discovery of the unconscious. It's an absolutely remarkable book a great work of scholarship

118
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
I think it it goes for about

119
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:39,348
250 pages before it even gets to Freud and so it places Freud's discoveries in their historical context

120
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,620
So that's a really good thing to know

121
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,769
Allen Burgess says it was a world shaped by man for man in which women occupied the second place

122
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,039
Political rights for women did not exist the separation and dissimilarity of the sexes was sharper than today

123
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:59,088
women who wore slacks their hair shorter smoked were hardly to be found and the universities admitted no female students, man's

124
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,798
Authority over his children and his wife was unquestioned education was authoritarian

125
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,739
The despotic father was a common figure and was particularly conspicuous only when he became extremely cruel

126
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,678
Laws were more repressive delinquent youth sternly punished and corporal punishment was considered indispensable

127
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,799
now

128
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:24,889
So the times themselves I would say were harsher and more repressive but then there was an element to sexuality that was also

129
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:27,929
Extraordinarily

130
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:35,329
Problematic. I mean the first thing you might notice might consider and people generally don't it's almost impossible to overstate

131
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,710
how

132
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,519
revolutionary the birth control pill actually is

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,779
You know people like to think that the political rights that women have attained have been a consequence of a political struggle

134
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,808
But I don't buy that for a second. I don't think that's true even in the least

135
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:56,329
I think that what happened was that we underwent a biological revolution in the 1950s late

136
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,819
1950s with the emergence of the birth control pill and that for the first time in human history gave women

137
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,819
Pretty reliable control over the reproductive function not really transformed them into entirely different biological

138
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:13,338
beings in many many ways like here's an example a subtle example, so, you know

139
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
if you track women through their

140
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,579
Ovulation cycle and you show them a picture of a man same man

141
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,639
And you do nothing but vary his jaw width

142
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,589
When they're ovulating the guy with the wider jaw is more attractive and when they're not

143
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,500
Ovulating the farthest away from that the guy with the thinner jaw is more attractive and that's associated with testosterone levels

144
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,528
And so women who are fertile like more masculine men and basically if you're on the pill then you're never in that

145
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,999
Ovulation phase and so one thing that may have happened and I don't know this for sure

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,129
but it's it's interesting to consider is that

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,700
Since women have been taking the birth control pill their preference for less

148
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:56,088
masculine men has become more pronounced and that could easily be one of the things that's fueling at least some of the tension that's

149
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,538
Existed and exists now politically between men and women, but the point is is that you just cannot ignore

150
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:10,489
The massive consequences of a biological revolution like that and to make any other factor causal when you're trying to understand

151
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:17,298
The political movement movements especially in the last say 40 years. It's you're putting the cart before the horse now

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,450
It's reasonable to point out that the pill wouldn't have been accepted as a technology if certain

153
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,418
Political changes with regards to the emancipation of women hadn't already been in place, right?

154
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,500
No one would have even been allowed to do something like investigate contraception

155
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,889
So you can't separate the biological from the political entirely

156
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:43,729
but it's still it's still very useful to organize your organizing your thinking to realize just how profound a

157
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,288
Revolution that was but now back in the Victorian times

158
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,189
There's another thing about sexuality

159
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,309
Modern people like to think that there's nothing dangerous about sex and that is like the stupidest thing you could possibly ever

160
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,120
Hypothesize because everything about it is dangerous. It's dangerous

161
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,879
Emotionally it's dangerous socially

162
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
it's dangerous because of the

163
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,979
Possibility of unwanted pregnancy and it's dangerous because of the possibility of sickness and that's a major one

164
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,470
I mean

165
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,790
So when aids emerged in the 1980s that could have easily killed all of us now the fact that it didn't was wonderful

166
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:21,500
But it did kill hundreds of millions of people. So it was no joke. It was a big deal and

167
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,189
ADEs

168
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,959
mutated to take advantage of promiscuity and so the

169
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,430
Relationship between sexual behavior and the transmission of disease is actually mediated at the biological level. But anyways back in the 1890s

170
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:39,978
They had the same problem, right? They had the problem with syphilis and syphilis is one nasty disease

171
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,819
it's it can mimic almost any other disease and it's devastating to your nervous system and you can pass it on to your children and

172
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:53,119
so part of the reason that sexuality was heavily repressed in the Victorian period was not only because of the

173
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:57,019
possibility of unwanted pregnancy the relative poverty of people

174
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:03,678
You know back in 1895 in Europe the average person lived on less than a dollar a day in in modern terms

175
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,060
You know

176
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:08,238
it's almost impossible to understand how poor people were and so

177
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,798
sex in a poverty-stricken place is also a lot more dangerous than it is in a rich place because especially if you were, you know,

178
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,318
given the lack of employment

179
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,179
opportunities for women back in the Victorian period if you happen to get pregnant out of wedlock you were and

180
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,870
You were in serious trouble

181
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,198
and so the fact that sexuality was repressed is hardly as hardly a

182
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:36,438
surprise because it was so difficult to integrate into the full-fledged personality, you know, and it has it as it still is so

183
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,990
Sexual repression

184
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,349
supposedly characteristic feature of the Victorian period was often merely the expression of two facts the lack of diffusion of

185
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:52,338
contraceptives and the fear of venereal disease it was all the more dangerous because of the great spread of prostitution and because prostitutes were almost

186
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:00,470
Invariably contaminated and therefore potential sources of infection we can hardly imagine today how monstrous silithus syphilis appeared to people of that time

187
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,350
Well, we can imagine that a little bit better than they could in 1970 because it hasn't you know, AIDS is still with us

188
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,899
Although it's nowhere near the plague that it was say

189
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,448
25 years ago

190
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,018
Well, here's the Freudian world Freud

191
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,039
so let's let's take a look at the history of or the idea of the

192
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,000
Unconscious to begin with and one of the things that you might want to consider

193
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:26,538
Conceptually is that there are many different forms of unconscious

194
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:33,230
There's not just one and so Alan bursae points out that by 1904 functions of the unconscious had been described

195
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,399
There's a conservative function. So the unconscious stores memories often unaccessible to voluntary recall

196
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,350
Well, that's a strange one, you know

197
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,350
obviously you remember your past but you don't remember all of

198
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:51,229
What you can remember at any given time and you don't really have access to that full store of memories

199
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,620
although you can try to remember so the unconscious is the

200
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,668
You could imagine the memories are represented somehow

201
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:06,589
Neurologically, but neural the neurological structure isn't exactly the mind like the neurological structure isn't exactly your consciousness

202
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,069
There's some relationship between them that we don't know and the unconscious

203
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,750
from a conceptual perspective is the place that your memories are that you

204
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,708
Sometimes can get access to and sometimes can't and so

205
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:25,039
you might think well that there are the memories that you can't get access to there might be a variety of reasons you can't get

206
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,860
access to them one might be that you've just forgotten them and

207
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,029
One might be that they're so painful that you don't want to bring them to mind

208
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:36,619
You'll you'll engage in tricks to stop yourself from getting access to them

209
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:43,129
And or maybe they're memories that are so complex that and painful that even if you did get access to them

210
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,139
You wouldn't exactly know what to do with them

211
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:50,479
and so there's not a lot of reason for you to bring them to mind because all it is is pain without any without any

212
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:56,718
Utility and when you understand that a little bit you understand more about what Freud meant by repression

213
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,319
The thing about Freud is that he kind of believed that

214
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,358
like many people believe now that when you remember an event in the past

215
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,419
It's it's almost as if you're using a video tape recorder and that when you experience that the memory is somehow

216
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,699
Recorded in you like it happened

217
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,798
But that's not a very accurate version of how memory works I mean

218
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,949
We know that memories can be easily distorted

219
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,270
for example

220
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:25,400
if you interview someone about an event and

221
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:31,970
You make suggestions that there was something present in the event that wasn't there and then you bring them back a couple of weeks later

222
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,470
And you ask them about the same event?

223
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,308
they'll often incorporate the thing that they were told into the event and

224
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:44,240
So and the idea that you can make an objective record of something that's happening to you is kind of a strange notion anyways

225
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,779
because so for example if you're having an argument with someone and

226
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,239
Later you I asked what the argument was about and the other person has asked what the argument is about

227
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,449
there's no necessary reason why the accounts will

228
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,750
Jibe at all because a lot of time when you're having an argument with someone you're arguing about what the argument is about

229
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,548
Right say well, you're angry at me. Well why this is why I think you're angry at me

230
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:13,759
You say no this is why I think this event has occurred and you're thinking about especially if we know each other

231
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,128
Well, you're thinking about the contextualization of that event across our entire history

232
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,309
and I'm doing the same thing and I'm gonna highlight things that you're not gonna highlight and I'm gonna draw causal inferences that you're not

233
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:29,689
Going to draw and for us just to get on the same page about the memory. It's going to be very difficult

234
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:34,849
So the idea that in specially with complex interactions with people that you can somehow

235
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,669
make a video recording of the memory and actually capture what happens is is very very

236
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,269
It's it's not true. You you can't I mean you might be able to extract out certain objective facts, but

237
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,918
But generally if it's a dialogical issue if it's a relationship issue

238
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,569
It spans such a long period of time that just cutting a slice of it out doesn't

239
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,558
constitute a reasonable record of what it means and

240
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:05,358
That's what you're more concerned with - like when when you have an experience, you know

241
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,389
I'm not so much concerned about what happened from an objective perspective

242
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,340
You're more concerned about what the experience means and then you might ask

243
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:19,279
Well, what does it mean to mean something and that was the question? I was trying to answer in that paper

244
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,048
I had you read right at the beginning of the class

245
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:25,038
but one of the things that meaning means is that it has

246
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,348
Implication for the way you look at the world or the way you act in the world. And so if I tell you something meaningful

247
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:35,149
what that's going to mean is in the future you're going to act slightly differently or maybe

248
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:41,058
Radically differently depending on how meaning it meaningful it is but also that the way that you look at the world has shifted

249
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:46,399
And the way that you look at the world is actually an unconscious. It's actually an unconscious process

250
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,919
I mean

251
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,030
You don't know

252
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,789
While you're looking at the world how it is or why it is that you're looking at the world in that way

253
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,009
I mean because well

254
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:01,128
First of all, it would just be too complicated and second you wouldn't be able to concentrate on what was actually going on

255
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,289
So your attention?

256
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:10,849
For example is mediated by unconscious forces and you know that you know that perfectly well and this is another Freudian observation, you know

257
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,849
if you're sitting down to

258
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,178
study

259
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,160
for example

260
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,058
your conscious intent is to study but you know perfectly well that all sorts of

261
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,959
Distraction fantasies are going to enter the theater of your imagination

262
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,230
Non-stop and annoyingly and and there isn't really a lot you can do about that except maybe wait it out, you know

263
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,298
So you'll be sitting there reading and your attention will flicker away. You'll think about I don't know

264
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,298
Maybe you want to watch the G in the virgin on Netflix or something like that

265
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,139
Or maybe it's time to have a peanut butter sandwich

266
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,949
or you should get the dust bunnies from out from underneath the bed or it's time to go outside and have a cigarette or maybe

267
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,529
It's time for a cup of coffee or it's like all these subsystems in you that would like something aren't

268
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:58,218
Very happy just to sit there while you read this thing that you're actually bored by and so they pop up and try to take

269
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,048
Control of your perceptions and your actions non-stop. Maybe you think well, this is a stupid course

270
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:07,969
Anyways, why do I have to read this damn paper? And what am I doing in university? And what's the point of life?

271
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,038
It's like you can really well

272
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,528
You can really get going if you're trying to avoid doing your homework and and and then you might think well

273
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,019
what is it in you that's trying to avoid because

274
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:24,469
After all, you took the damn course and you told yourself to sit down. Why don't you listen?

275
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:32,568
Well, because you're you're a mess now. That's basically why you haven't got control over yourself at all

276
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,168
And no more than I have control over this laptop

277
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:44,808
Okay, so there's the memory function of the unconscious and there's the dis dis eluted function

278
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:51,499
That's an interesting one the unconscious contains habits once voluntary now are tamo ties and dissociated

279
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,088
Elements of the personality which may lead a parasitic existence. That's an interesting one

280
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:02,538
I would relate that more to procedural memory, you know, so what you've done is practice certain habits, whatever they might be

281
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,559
Let's call them bad habits and you like those things to get under control?

282
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,878
But you can't so maybe when you're speaking for example, you use like and you know

283
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,189
And you say I'm a lot and you've practiced that so you're really good at it and you'd like to stop it

284
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,289
But you don't - because you've built that little machine right into your being right? It's

285
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:26,450
Neurologically wired and it's not under conscious control and anything you practice

286
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,900
becomes that

287
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,150
It becomes part of you and and that's another element of the unconscious a different part

288
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,538
And then there's a creative part which is that well

289
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:39,409
You know you're sitting around and maybe you're trying to write something or maybe you want to

290
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,038
Produce a piece of art or a piece of music or maybe you're just laying in bed dreaming and you have all these weird ideas

291
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,590
And especially in dreams. It's like what where do those things come from and even more strange?

292
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,699
One of the things that's really weird about dreams and almost impossibly weird is that you're an observer in the dream

293
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:06,259
It's like a dream is something that happens to you. Well, you're dreaming it theoretically so how is it that you can be an observer?

294
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,019
It's almost like you're watching a video game or a movie but you're producing it that at least in principle

295
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,860
Although the psychoanalysts would say well, no not exactly your ego isn't producing it. Your unconscious is producing. It's a different thing

296
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:24,409
It's a different thing. And of course Jung would say well it's deeper than that. The collective unconscious might be producing it

297
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,769
It's in some sense

298
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:26,970
It isn't you?

299
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,470
exactly

300
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,259
or it isn't the you that you think of when you think of you and that's the ego from the Freudian perspective the you that

301
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,298
you identify with that's the ego and

302
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,849
outside of that is the unconscious the it'd

303
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,259
That's more the place of impulses and you could think about those as the biological

304
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,068
Subsystems that can derail your thinking right and that govern things like hunger and sex and aggression and your basic

305
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,660
instincts is another way of putting it and it's a reasonable way of thinking about it because these are

306
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,799
Subsystems that you share with with animals you share them certainly with mammals

307
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:03,288
You share most of them with reptiles you share a lot of them with em Finian's and even going all the way down to

308
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:07,249
Crustaceans there's commonality for example in the dominance hierarchy circuits

309
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,588
and so these are very very old things and the idea that you're in control of them is

310
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:19,668
Well, you're not exactly in control of them and I would say the less integrated you are

311
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:26,480
The less you're in control of them and the more they're in control of you and that can get really out of hand, you know

312
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,249
You can be like with people who have obsessive compulsive disorder. For example

313
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,390
which which which is

314
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,590
Which seems to be I would say that dissolute of elements in some sense of the unconscious the way that it's portrayed here

315
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,519
Poor people with obsessive-compulsive disorder they can spend half their time

316
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,820
Doing things that they can't really control and they have very strong

317
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,329
Impulses to do them and it's very hard on them to block them

318
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:54,710
You know, they they'll almost panic if those things are blocked and then you have people with Tourette's syndrome

319
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,759
you know that they'll be doing all sorts of weird dances and

320
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:03,619
spouting off obscenities and and and and imitating people

321
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,410
without being able to control it and and

322
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,989
Sometimes a little bit of anti-psychotic medication can dampen that down but it's as if there are these autonomous

323
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:19,099
semi spirits inside of them that grip control over their behavior and make them do things and you know,

324
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,408
you find that to some degree in your own life because maybe

325
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,748
You've become very attractive to someone even maybe you don't want to be attracted to the person and then you find yourself

326
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,429
You know texting them when you know perfectly well that you should be going to bed and you know

327
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,629
you're you're in a grip of something and and you can't control it and that's all part of the

328
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,849
unconscious and all part of what Freud was studying

329
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,730
The dynamic unconscious it's alive and it's a compass that the mind is a composite of contradictory drives now

330
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,278
The way Freud thought about this basically was that with the end and the ego and the super-ego

331
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,440
so if you think about the end as the place where these contradictory drives emerge

332
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,048
So it's sort of nature within the ego is the thing that's sort of being pushed back and forth by those

333
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:10,339
Contradictory drives and the super-ego is the thing that's on top saying you better behave yourself you better behave yourself and so it's a different

334
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:14,509
model than the Piaget daeun model because Piaget assumed that what would happen is that

335
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,408
As the child and I like the Piaget and model better

336
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,790
I think I think in healthy development the Piaget daeun model is correct

337
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,529
But in unhealthy development

338
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,599
I think the Freudian model is correct that

339
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:33,680
Instead of integrating say the aggressive and sexual drives for the sake of argument into your personality as you develop

340
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,230
What happens is the super-ego just represses them instead so they don't become a dynamic part of you

341
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,970
Integrated into your ego. They're just repressed. You just don't manifest them and

342
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,549
That's how you be a good person and you can be the victim of a very harsh

343
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,689
super-ego and that often happens if you've had a particularly tyrannical

344
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:58,019
Parent one or both or maybe a tyrannical grandparent or maybe you're your own inner tyrant

345
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,999
And you've picked up tyrannical voices through your whole life and aggregated them into this terrible judge

346
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,990
that's always watching you that's criticizing everything you do and

347
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,318
Restricting you badly and really badly and what you're allowed and not allowed to do you see that with anorexic women?

348
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,220
Well men could be anorexic too, but it's much much less rare

349
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,250
They have super egos that are just or one way of thinking about it

350
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,500
That's just they're just deadly they're just criticizing every bit of them. Well right to the point

351
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,949
They're really criticizing them out of existence right is you have to be so perfect that the perfection is not

352
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:38,128
Aligned with the ability to live you don't get to eat, you know and and people like that

353
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,270
They look at their bodies

354
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:41,999
they even look at their bodies incorrectly like

355
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,120
anorexic seem to be unable to see their bodies as a whole they can only see their bodies as parts and

356
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,190
When you start seeing your body as parts

357
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,070
you're really in trouble because you can't get a sense of actually what it looks like and body perception is very very complicated, but

358
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,570
anyways

359
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:04,470
Piaget thought about the ego as in some sense as the game that's played by all these

360
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,729
Dynamic drives that's shaped by the broader community. And so that could all be integrated

361
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,848
But Freud would say well look when that doesn't happen instead

362
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:16,409
You're subject to the tyranny of the super-ego and it just says you should never be angry, right?

363
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,190
You should never express yourself sexually because if you do there's something wrong with you

364
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:26,279
you're a bad person and you're a bad person if you ever get aggressive or and so and then people who are

365
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,470
living like that under those circumstances

366
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,709
You know they get they well they're they're repressed is the right way to think about it

367
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,819
Now Freud was interested in the idea that mental disorders could be caused for two reasons one would be purely

368
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,659
Bodily, like maybe a head injury or say in the case of schizophrenia

369
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,028
Which is a good example of manic depressive disorder

370
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,099
we have reason to believe that there's something

371
00:28:53,529 --> 00:29:00,088
Physiological going on even though but identifying that has been very difficult and it's because there isn't one form of schizophrenia

372
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:02,518
there's probably many pathways of

373
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,628
brain injury that lead to

374
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:11,009
schizophrenic like symptoms and there's likely not one form of manic depressive disorder either if you think of the form as having a

375
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,778
Standard causal pathway. We know that there are because we've done genetic Studies on people

376
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:23,578
Who have manic depressive disorder in their family and you can identify genes within a family that seemed to be contributing to the disorder?

377
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:26,308
but the problem is is that those genes don't seem to be

378
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:32,939
so then you'll take another family group with manic depressive disorder and it'll be a different genetic combination that causes that so

379
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
so part of the reason why

380
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,808
It's difficult to associate the even the more biological

381
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:47,370
Mental disorders with with biology all the way down is because they're so complex and then there are other forms of mental

382
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,239
Disorder that don't seem to be structure at all structural at all

383
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,829
They seem to have more to do with well

384
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:59,490
Let's call it the psyche right and that it's more like the contents of your thought have a problem rather than the structures

385
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:05,100
Underlying your thought and of course that distinction is difficult to make in a fine-grained way

386
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,689
But you kind of get the point

387
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:13,440
I mean just because there's an error in your thinking doesn't mind really mean that the underlying biology in some sense has been

388
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,110
compromised it's complicated because if the air is bad enough, then it can compromise the underlying biology but

389
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:24,688
but whatever it's a conceptual distinction and part of the conceptual distinction is is

390
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:31,318
Helpful, if you're trying to think at least in part about how you might cure it because if you're thinking about a brain disease

391
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,869
then that

392
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:39,749
Implies a different course of treatment at least in principle then it does if you're thinking about a psychological

393
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:41,439
disorder where you might

394
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,190
think about talking to someone for example and straightening out their thoughts or helping them learn to behave in a different way and

395
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:50,109
It was really Freud

396
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,638
Who started to?

397
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:58,978
Think that he was the first person to really pause it and this is pretty interesting that directly pause it that dialogue or conversation

398
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:01,858
Or speaking could be curative

399
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,568
And now that's another thing that people don't like to give him credit for I mean there wouldn't be all these

400
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:12,449
helping industries social social work and psychology and and

401
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,410
Biological Psychiatry insofar as that also involves communication and counseling and all these things now that would have existed

402
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,719
In all likelihood if Freud wouldn't have made the original

403
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,340
hypothesis that

404
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:30,750
There was something about communication that could be curative. No

405
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,630
Freud believed that

406
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:43,379
Experiences that hadn't been now. He thought about experiences has repressed and this goes back to the videotape idea of memory

407
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,229
so the idea would be that you have a record of everything that's happened to you and the records actually accurate and

408
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:54,660
then some of those things that happen to you were very very shocking to you were very hurtful or very

409
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,959
depressing or very threatening and so you've decided that you're

410
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:04,739
Those have become repressed you're not paying any attention to them now

411
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,959
He has a complex mechanism to account for that and I actually think this is a place where his theory went badly wrong

412
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,749
because you don't have a videotape memory and

413
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:20,609
It isn't obvious that the memories that you have of traumatic events are fully fledged and causally

414
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:26,249
appropriate but just not paid attention to it's more like they're murky and

415
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,299
Unclear in and of themselves and they contain too much and I don't think that people so much repress as they do

416
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:40,110
refuse to attend to or are unable to attend to so it's more like a passive avoidance than a

417
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:45,029
Passive avoidance of something that needs to be explored and gone through rather than it is

418
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,099
something you know that you don't want to look at that you are part of you has put away and

419
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,879
and I think that's a major weakness in his theory and has led to a lot of

420
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,049
Problems with the idea of repression per se. But anyways, that was his idea that

421
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:03,838
Terrible things have happened to you and you or some part of you doesn't want to

422
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:12,868
To know about them to know about them. And so they live this those repressed experiences live an autonomous life of their own - and

423
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,430
You here's an example of a trivial example of how that might work

424
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,099
imagine that you're at work and

425
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,009
Your boss says something to you that disturbs you maybe it makes you question whether your job is stable

426
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,360
So you're kind of set about that

427
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:33,958
But it's a casual offhand comment and you go back to work and you just sort of forget that that even happened, you know

428
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,089
Maybe because you're attending to something else

429
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,480
but then you go home and you're just

430
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,170
Crabby as can possibly be and you go home and one of the people there says something a little annoying and you snap at them

431
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,910
It's like well that's analogous to what Freud would call a complex, right?

432
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,959
Is that this because you could imagine what's happened is that the boss's words have brought up a whole little sub personality

433
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,889
predicated on doubt

434
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,849
Up to the surface and who knows how deep that would be?

435
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:03,750
Well what happens if I lose my job and if I lose my job, well, what sort of person am I?

436
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:09,809
Exactly. And what about all these other times that I've failed and then maybe you remember the other times that you failed and what am

437
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:15,719
I going to do in the future. So it's this whole cluster of ideas that surrounds that doubt and that's been activated

438
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,188
It's a little part of you and then maybe you're not attending to that because you're busy doing some other work

439
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,090
But when you go home something triggers it and like it's already there

440
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,399
It's all you get way more upset than you should and that's that's what a complex is except in a much more

441
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:34,049
complicated manner like a complex might be a whole series of

442
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,809
experiences that you've had that are united by some emotion like threat

443
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,399
That aren't haven't been transformed into a coherent representation

444
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,860
But that can rise out of the unconscious and possess you if you guys many of you guys have been

445
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,668
Depressed at at least one point in your life, you know, it's actually very common for University of Toronto students

446
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,730
especially in their first year

447
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,228
It's about one in three if you if you have students the Beck Depression Inventory

448
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:11,280
But one in three taught University of Toronto students in our research have have hit criteria for hospitalization

449
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,199
I mean the back is a little oversensitive as far as I'm concerned, but but you know what? It's like when you're depressed

450
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:23,638
It's like it's it's it's a part of your personality sort of subsumes the whole and depression quite classically is well

451
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,409
You can't think of anything good that happened to you in the past and you can't think of any reason why the present is good

452
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:33,449
For anything and you're pretty damn hopeless about the future and so that's a complex as well

453
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:38,158
and it's a complex that consists of nothing but negative emotion and it structures your

454
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:42,208
Memory and your percept and your plans for the future all at the same time

455
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,349
now

456
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:50,818
Freud had a very lengthy list of ways that people could be treacherous towards

457
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:56,278
Experiences they had that they wanted to repress and so he called them defense mechanisms

458
00:35:56,278 --> 00:36:04,048
This is how you fool yourself into believing that you don't have to take into account a certain set of negative experiences

459
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,278
you know, it's like

460
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:13,858
Well, we'll go through the repression. Okay. Well we talked about that denial. Well that often denial is a very complicated one

461
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,789
See if I can come up with a good example

462
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:28,768
It was a classic example for people who have I think it's called anis Ignasi, I don't remember exactly it's neglect

463
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:32,337
That's a less technical way of thinking about so let's say you have a right parietal

464
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:39,268
Damage from a stroke and you lose the left side of your body so you can't move it anymore, but worse you don't know

465
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:41,428
It's there and you don't know that the left side of anything

466
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:47,398
Is there anymore and god only knows how that happens but like you'll only eat half the food on your plate only on the right

467
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,039
hand side and if someone asks you to draw a clock you'll cram all the numbers into the one side and so you kind of

468
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,778
Lose the idea of left and I think it's sort of like, you know how when you're looking forward

469
00:36:57,778 --> 00:37:03,478
There's nothing behind you. You can't see anything back here. It's it's not black. It's not even gone

470
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:09,237
It's just simply not there at all. And so if you could imagine that sort of stretching around halfway

471
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:16,648
That seems to be something what neglect is like, but anyways, if you if you take someone with neglect according to Ramachandra

472
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,829
and then if you irrigate their ear with cold water the

473
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:25,409
Ear on the opposite side, then they'll kind of have a little convulsion and then all of a sudden

474
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:29,277
They become aware of their missing left side

475
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:32,849
If you talk to them before you do the irrigation, you say well well

476
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,849
what's up with your left arm and they'll say well I

477
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,998
My arthritis is bothering me and I don't want to move it they come up with some

478
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,509
Something that sounds akin to denial, you know

479
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:46,378
And then if you can snap them out of that with that irrigation and they'll have a catastrophic

480
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:48,758
emotional response

481
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,599
logically enough to the loss of their entire left side and

482
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:57,628
Ramachandran report that lasting about 20 minutes and then they'll snap out of it and go right back into the denial and

483
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,210
sometimes people deny things because

484
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,980
They can't update what's happened to them is so overwhelming that they cannot

485
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,989
Construct a new model. They just rely on the old one and you see this

486
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,039
Well, imagine first that you've just had a tooth pulled and you know

487
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,550
How many how long your tongue takes to like remap the inside of your mouth?

488
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:24,629
It's really hard to come up with a new concept of you if something catastrophic happens, and so sometimes the denial is just that

489
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,038
Something the thing that has happened is so overwhelming that the person can't model it

490
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,509
But then maybe also they refuse to think about it and you see this

491
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,519
emerging in lots of strange ways

492
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,059
so for example, if people develop diabetes, for example

493
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:44,788
They're often not very good at taking their medication or regulating their diet and you might say well they're denying the existence

494
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,950
of their illness and to some degree

495
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,869
They're probably doing that because who the hell wants to think that they're diabetic but even worse than that

496
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,119
It's like it's complicated to be diabetic

497
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,878
You're no longer the same person that you were and so you have to learn a whole bunch of new ways to be this new

498
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,269
Person what to eat when to eat how to check your blood

499
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,780
you have to be careful whenever you go out and eat like there's there's a

500
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,688
Hundred new things a day that you have to learn and so separating denial from inability is a hard one

501
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:19,079
But you can also understand that people might deny. No, that's just not happening. That's that's I'm not going to admit to that

502
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:26,458
Reaction formation. Oh, that's one. Maybe you hate your sister and maybe you have your reasons, but you shouldn't hate your sister

503
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,438
So what you do is act as if you really really like her. That's an overcompensation

504
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,708
So that's another form of defense mechanism

505
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,610
displacement

506
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:41,639
My boss yells at me. I yell at my husband. My husband yells at the baby the baby bites the cat

507
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,760
Well, they're not really dealing with the problem, which is the boss. It's just pushed on down the road and

508
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:55,708
Identification you're bullied and instead of coming to terms with the fact that bullying occurs. You start bullying other people

509
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,889
Rationalization, well, you know what that means already, you know

510
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:07,019
Maybe you don't do your homework you're procrastinating. I bet you can come up with fifteen rauch

511
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:12,269
No problem for why it's actually not necessary for you to do your homework right then

512
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,219
Intellectualization what Woody Allen's movies are about like that. He's got all these neurotic problems, but he's smart and so he can come up with

513
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:25,768
Intelligent reasons why he's so messed up even though he knows he's messed up and it doesn't help

514
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,700
sublimation

515
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:32,069
Well that that was one of the things that Freud thought characterized art

516
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,709
So for example, there's a lot of erotic content in art

517
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,990
and

518
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:37,408
so if you're having trouble establishing a

519
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,320
relationship or if you want to have a relationship with many people then maybe what you do is sculpt nudes or paint them and then

520
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,389
there's projection which is

521
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:53,099
I'm having an argument with you and I'm unwilling to admit to my moat my dark motivations, and I'm very skeptical of you

522
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:58,168
And so I assume that you're characterized by all the dark motivations that I won't admit to in myself

523
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
so

524
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,369
Now Freud also believed that it was unconscious ideas that were at the core of psychological conflicts and he

525
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,519
Described those conflicts as incomprehensible distress

526
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,509
psychosomatic symptoms and so those would be the manifestation of

527
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,789
psychological of

528
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:26,699
The manifestation of psychological content in bodily form that might be stress a stress-related illness might be one way of thinking about that

529
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,820
I've had clients who had hysterical epilepsy. So that was quite interesting. So that was a somatic

530
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:35,369
manifestation of a psychological problem

531
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,460
back when Freud was

532
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,570
practicing

533
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,119
Hysteria was much more common

534
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,059
and maybe that was partly because Victorian society was so

535
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:51,359
Centred on the theater and so dramatic and people would come in with like a paralyzed arm or something like that that he could

536
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,960
Sort out with hypnosis, and so they were manifesting their

537
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:01,498
Psychological distress in bodily form often in a manner that was representative of that

538
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
psychological conflict in some way

539
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,990
Behavioral anomalies hallucinations and delusions. He thought that all of those could be

540
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,000
manifestations of

541
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,539
inner internal psychological conflict with their sets of unconscious ideas, so

542
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:22,498
You know, let's go back to the - the boss example

543
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,438
Your boss says something nasty to you. Come home

544
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,608
Someone says something a bit

545
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:32,969
Provoking and you fly off the handle and then you have an argument about what the hell is up with you because they say well

546
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:37,739
Look what I said was, you know this big and you reacted like this and you're gonna say, well no

547
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,989
No, you're always annoying like that

548
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:45,239
And which is kind of a denial thing and maybe the person doesn't let up and they say no

549
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,649
No, I really know that something's wrong

550
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,088
And you do like six other things to keep them the hell away from you and finally they're persistent enough

551
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:56,547
so you break down crying and you say well I had this terrible day at work and you didn't even really notice that you

552
00:42:56,798 --> 00:43:04,288
knew that until the moment of the moment of the tears and you see that very frequently in psychotherapy - if you're talking to people

553
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,880
for example

554
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,980
Maybe they're relating a story about their their marriage that collapse badly and they're talking and all of a sudden

555
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,349
they'll say something and they'll tear up and

556
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:17,608
Then they'll continue and you can grab that you say look you just said something

557
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:22,527
I noticed that your eyes filled with tears when you said that what was going through your mind

558
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:26,548
Now often they'll they unless you catch it quick they'll forget

559
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:31,980
So they're talking and they'll have and the talking about the past is you know

560
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:36,178
flashing off imagistic memories and you'll say well that made you cry and

561
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,249
And they often don't like that because for obvious reasons that something's come up that

562
00:43:41,528 --> 00:43:43,298
they don't want to talk about and

563
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:48,179
So you say well what was flashing through your mind and the person will tell you like quite a lengthy

564
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:53,428
little memory fantasy about a sequence of events that you know is still a

565
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:58,949
Hot-button issue and that's another example of this underlying complex, you know

566
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:00,759
and if you watch people

567
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,878
You can watch people in normal conversation

568
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,869
this happens all the times their eyes will move or they'll smile or you can see as

569
00:44:06,998 --> 00:44:10,408
They're speaking that all sorts of different ideas are flitting through their head

570
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:16,288
It's dreamlike in a sense - it's sort of as if the person is talking and they're dreaming at the same time

571
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:21,567
There's this image Laden set of memories that's going on at the same time and that can be quite broad

572
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:24,807
far broader than they could encapsulate in the words and

573
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:31,378
so you can catch that and if you're really listening to someone really paying attention to them you can see when they're doubtful or when

574
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,599
They pause for a long time. That's another one

575
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:39,778
You know that some things come up that that that's occupying their mind and interfering with the flow of conversation

576
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,688
Freud was very good at listening in that manner

577
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:47,038
While that happens with jokes too, you know and

578
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,418
Like for example when I was showing you guys the Lion King

579
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,400
Stills the other day and I showed you that picture of nella laying on her back with that

580
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,298
peculiar expression on her face everybody immediately laughed and

581
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,409
the you be Freud would have considered that an entry point into the

582
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,188
Unconscious because there is a reason you were laughing about it. It goes along with it

583
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:08,429
well

584
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:14,789
it would have gone along with a sexual complex in that situation and everybody recognizes it instantly and they laugh about it and

585
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:18,239
Comedians are really good at that because if they're good comedians

586
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,340
They say what everyone's thinking but no one will say and it's a relief to everyone. You know, he

587
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:25,949
What's his name?

588
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:35,160
Canadian comedian so he's making racial jokes. No. No, it's Canadian. Uh, yeah Russell Russell Peters

589
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,989
I mean, he's a great example of that, you know

590
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:42,659
He feels a whole stadium with people of all different ethnicities and every single one of them is dying to be

591
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,209
Insulted because of their racial background, you know

592
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,269
it's a relief to

593
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:51,239
everyone so he had salts the herbs and then he insults the Jews and then he insults the Christians and he's going

594
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:53,250
Oh, I'm so glad finally someone said that

595
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,889
No, so so he's speaking to part of their unconscious and it's the part that's actually uncomfortable with all of that kind of discussion

596
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,289
Being repressed and staying below the surface

597
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:10,228
It's way too weighty for people so jokes expressed in playful language what culture will not?

598
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,269
formally express so

599
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,019
You know to that when the culture starts going after the comedian's that things are not good

600
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,150
So you should leave the damn comedians alone

601
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:22,588
Because there are the people that can tell the truth and if you start to get annoyed at them, then that's not good

602
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,260
so

603
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,898
So a Freud was also extraordinarily interested in dreams

604
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:38,699
Poor Freud who were just not gonna be able to cover him in enough detail. Well, um,

605
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:43,648
How will we do this because I should tell you about the dreams

606
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:52,079
Freud wrote a book called the interpretation of dreams and he he was the first person I would say who

607
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:56,128
subjected dreams to a really comprehensive analysis and he used them to

608
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:05,129
Investigate the place of complexes in his psychotherapeutic practice. So his clients would recount their dreams to him now

609
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:11,430
He believed that dreams always expressed an unconscious wish and that was tied into his theory of repression

610
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:15,058
And so for example if you were very very sexually repressed

611
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:22,079
which was very common at the time then you'd have dreams with sexual content that we're expressing the the

612
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,248
expressing the

613
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:31,708
Undesirable fantasy essentially and by analyzing the dream you could get down to what you could get down to what was being repressed

614
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,829
now Freud believed that the dream

615
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:37,318
more or less tied itself in knots

616
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:38,649
trying to hide its

617
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,059
Content in some sense and Jung believed instead that the dream was actually trying to be as clear as it could it just wasn't part

618
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,788
Of the let's call it the semantic memory system

619
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:50,248
It was it was more like a feeler out into the unknown

620
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:51,970
it was trying to

621
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:58,259
Represent things as clearly as it could and so its use of symbols and that sort of thing wasn't so much to hide the actual

622
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:05,190
Unpleasant content from the dreamer but to express it in the only language that the dream could use and so Freud

623
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,039
Of course also believed that some of that was true

624
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,518
All right. Well, we're gonna have to stop there. So

625
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,518
since it's 2 o'clock, so we'll see you on

626
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:17,608
Tuesday

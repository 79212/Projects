2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,260
today we're going to talk a little bit

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:22,570
more about the fractionation of openness

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:24,099
to experience and we've done a fair

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,899
number of studies with the Big Five

6
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:28,419
aspect scale which we talked about a lot

7
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,789
which enables the Big Five model to be

8
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:35,170
differentiated down into two aspects per

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:37,420
trait and those aspects have been useful

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,609
for a variety of reasons for example

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,579
when we're looking at political behavior

12
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:44,530
we've been able to determine that

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,539
conservatives who are generally regarded

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,820
as higher in conscientiousness are

15
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,800
actually more specifically higher in

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,018
orderliness it's not a lot of difference

17
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,578
between liberals and conservatives with

18
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:57,100
regards to industriousness and we've

19
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,588
also been able to determine at least to

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,100
some degree that orderliness seems to be

21
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:04,329
associated with disgust sensitivity and

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,189
disgust sensitivity as part of the

23
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,379
behavioural immune system and so part of

24
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:10,239
the reasons that conservatives are more

25
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,859
inclined to want things like close

26
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,509
borders is because they're more

27
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:15,189
concerned about maintaining the

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,890
boundaries between things and the reason

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:20,739
for that seems to be fundamentally

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,239
associated with disgust and I'll talk to

31
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:25,269
you a lot about that next week because

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,478
once we've sorted that out it really

33
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:29,978
really illuminated my way of thinking

34
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,289
about things that had happened for

35
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:34,799
example in Nazi Germany because people

36
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:37,118
tend to people tend to think about like

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,039
when people have been studying

38
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,930
conservatism from the scientific

39
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,789
perspective they've tended to assume

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,829
that it's associated with fear of the

41
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,149
out-group say and the Conservatives are

42
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,788
more fearful the Liberals but that

43
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,780
actually doesn't seem to be

44
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,280
conservatives are not hiring trait

45
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,200
neuroticism and that's a really tough

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,030
one because if you are going to make a

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,189
case that a group one group is more

48
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,659
anxious let's say or threat sensitive

49
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:00,339
than another and you don't get

50
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:10,360
differences in treatment autism then

51
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:12,099
you've really got a problem well yeah

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,260
but the theories the theories seem to be

53
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,229
more trade like rather than situation

54
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,209
yeah so so but what we have found is

55
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,649
that that you know for a long time

56
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,260
people thought that all of the negative

57
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,760
emotions loaded on neuroticism and it

58
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,408
was like the global

59
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,199
the global trade for negative emotion

60
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:32,408
but disgust seems to be its own peculiar

61
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:36,158
thing and but I will talk to you more

62
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:38,469
about that next week and but that's just

63
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:40,929
an example of why differentiation at the

64
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,669
aspect level seems useful you also pick

65
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,590
up differences between men and women at

66
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:47,048
the aspect level that aren't obvious at

67
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,900
the trade level as well so you can think

68
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,670
about the model says you know you have a

69
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,610
model that operates at different levels

70
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,449
of resolution and low resolution

71
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,780
representations are good for one set of

72
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,518
operations and higher resolution

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,870
representations are good for other

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,340
purposes and the purpose of course is to

75
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,680
predict at least that's one of the

76
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,539
primary scientific purposes and so you

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,340
pick the level of analysis that gives

78
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,318
you the most prediction and perhaps also

79
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,890
the most utility in terms of formulating

80
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:16,500
scientific theories so and so we'll

81
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,878
concentrate a little bit more today on

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,568
openness per se so openness to

83
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,679
experience fragments into intellect and

84
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,060
openness proper and I think the right

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,090
way to think about intellect is that

86
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,560
it's the personality instantiation of IQ

87
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,299
roughly speaking and the reason I think

88
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,479
that is because well first of all

89
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,579
working memory predicts intellect quite

90
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,068
nicely and working memory tests are very

91
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,319
very highly correlated with G and

92
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,780
specifically G being the first factor

93
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:44,979
that you pull out of any set of IQ tests

94
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,400
right that that's the technical

95
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,379
definition of G you set up sets of

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,090
questions do a factor analysis and

97
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:54,129
extract out the first factor which is

98
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,829
roughly equivalent by the way to the

99
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,750
total or to that to the mean of the

100
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,250
items if it's if there's a one factor

101
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,560
solution it's not much different than

102
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,310
the average so the average is actually a

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,229
factor that's that that where the

104
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,049
hypothesis is that every single item

105
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,098
loads equally on that factor because

106
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,139
you're adding them all up and then

107
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,399
dividing them by the number so it's no

108
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:17,319
different than a factor analysis

109
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,608
sometimes you'll hear people like Steve

110
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,379
and Jay Google did this when he was

111
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,109
complaining about IQ back in the 90s he

112
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,098
said a factor and a factor analysis like

113
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,430
a factor is just a mathematical

114
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:28,990
abstraction it's like well yeah so is

115
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,598
the average you think it's the average

116
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,430
of a set of numbers real and answer that

117
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:35,860
question is depends on how you define

118
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,240
real you can use it for certain

119
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,310
functions which is a pretty good

120
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,590
definition of real

121
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,480
as far as I'm concerned but when you ask

122
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,159
questions like that you have to define

123
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,330
both your terms and you do that somewhat

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,800
arbitrarily anyways people with high IQs

125
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,389
tend to think that they're smart which

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,160
is and that's right and so then they can

127
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,810
to describe themselves as smart if you

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,640
give them the opportunity to do that and

129
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,230
then that shows up when you ask them

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,209
questions about their problem-solving

131
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,879
ability and that loads mostly on

132
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,620
intellect and so it isn't even obvious

133
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,050
that there's any real utility in

134
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,509
assessing intellect from the self-report

135
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,550
perspective when you could replace that

136
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:15,120
with an IQ test because the IQ test is

137
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,410
way more accurate so but that gives you

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,670
some sense you think about the whole

139
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,470
five factor model you know where

140
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,650
intelligence slots it slots in

141
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,870
underneath opens now the openness proper

142
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:26,459
part of openness to experience which

143
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,519
which I tend to think about as

144
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,899
creativity you can use that at least as

145
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,879
a shorthand to sort of aid your

146
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,569
understanding of what it is creativity

147
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,129
seems related to IQ in that more people

148
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,930
with higher IQs are likely to be

149
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,909
creative or if you take people who are

150
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,230
noted for their creativity there's a

151
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,189
high probability that they'll have a

152
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:50,550
higher IQ but there's more to it than IQ

153
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:52,889
and and what what creativity seems to be

154
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,389
associated with then again depends on

155
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,639
whether or not on how you define

156
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,310
creativity because you could define it

157
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,719
as the sum total of creative

158
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,370
achievements that you've made in your

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,830
life which would be the actual

160
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,959
production of say artifacts of one form

161
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,599
or another performances or inventions or

162
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,129
artworks or or what-have-you we'll go

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
over the dimensions in the middle in a

164
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,240
minute or you could also define it as

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,099
the proclivity to engage in creative

166
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,139
thought and I think we'll start with

167
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,560
that first so what does it mean to think

168
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,159
creatively it's it's sort of like it's

169
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,139
something like this you imagine that I

170
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,939
toss you out an idea and there's some

171
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,620
probability that when I toss you that

172
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,230
idea that that will trigger off other

173
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,060
ideas in your imagination so you can

174
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,350
think about it as a threshold issue if

175
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,420
you're not very creative I'll throw you

176
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,370
an idea and hardly any other ideas will

177
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,960
be triggered and the ones that will be

178
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,629
triggered are going to be very closely

179
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,329
associated with that initial idea so

180
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:50,069
let's say I toss each of you an idea and

181
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:52,109
I asked you to think tell me the first

182
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,480
thing that comes to mind okay so what we

183
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,819
would see first is that the first thing

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,470
that comes to mind for you the first

185
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,500
thing that comes to mind in like in all

186
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,610
likelihood we'd be shared by many of you

187
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,529
okay so then you can think about that as

188
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,569
a common response right and so that's a

189
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,549
less creative response and then there'll

190
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,649
be some things that come to mind for you

191
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,180
that are that they're so idiosyncratic

192
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,459
that you're the only person that thinks

193
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,650
that and no one can understand it well

194
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,199
that's also not exactly creative because

195
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:20,729
the thing that you for something to be

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,680
creative it has to be novel and useful

197
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,410
at the same time that's sort of rough

198
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,050
definition creative something creative

199
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,670
is novel and useful and obviously you

200
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,579
know there's a there's a certain amount

201
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,949
of judgment that goes along with that

202
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:36,689
clearly but if it's too novel then no

203
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,819
one else can understand it and it's

204
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,189
unlikely to be useful so there's there's

205
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,389
a there's a range of convenience so

206
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:44,129
anyways if you want to decide if

207
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,889
something's creative like what we would

208
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,149
do for I could say to you okay in the

209
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,029
next three minutes I want you to write

210
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:53,459
down all the uses you can think of for a

211
00:07:51,029 --> 00:08:01,679
brick so okay so someone tell me your

212
00:07:53,459 --> 00:08:05,909
use for a brick breaking windows yes

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,819
okay what else can use a brick for build

214
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,140
a wall it's very small wall haha a wall

215
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:16,949
for ant and what else

216
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,599
paperweight okay okay well so you get

217
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,629
the idea you're not feeling very multi

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,900
today obviously but so so you see that

219
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,550
so if we gathered your responses say I

220
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,439
said you have to think of 20 items that

221
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,379
20 things that that you could do with a

222
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,940
brick then a bunch of the things that

223
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,960
you thought would be the same and some

224
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,340
people would come up with something

225
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,930
different like yours was reasonably

226
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,490
different than one about using it as a

227
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,659
publish stone for your feet but someone

228
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,820
else might come up with that but it's

229
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,009
it's a good creative response because

230
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,280
it's unexpected and it you could

231
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:49,319
actually do it you know so anyway so

232
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,740
you'll get a graph of probability of

233
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,260
response right and the more probable the

234
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,639
less creative roughly speaking it's not

235
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,769
the only criteria though because you

236
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,269
also have to look at utility so if I

237
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,980
said okay you've got three minutes to

238
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,759
write down as many uses as you can think

239
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,470
of for a brick

240
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,639
I would score that in a variety of ways

241
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,019
the first thing I would do is

242
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,569
just figure out how many uses you

243
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,829
generated that's called fluency and we

244
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,210
could also do that I could just say

245
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,770
write down as many words as you can

246
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,389
begin with the letter s in three minutes

247
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,220
or that begin with the letter C or

248
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,620
four-letter words that begin with the

249
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,960
letter D no I can I can constrain it and

250
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,870
if I counted how many words you

251
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,250
generated if I had an IQ measure and I

252
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,710
had a measure of how many words you

253
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,389
generated IQ plus the number of words

254
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,580
that you generated would be a better

255
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,069
predictor of your creativity than just

256
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,410
IQ so there's this fluency element

257
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,240
that's and so that's something like the

258
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,769
rate at which you can produce say verbal

259
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,299
ideas and one of the things we do know

260
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:47,100
about about the creativity dimension of

261
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,990
openness is that it is associated with

262
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,220
fluency and it's also associated with

263
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,740
originality and originality would be how

264
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:59,190
improbable your use was compared to the

265
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,259
uses generated by other people so so

266
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,460
anyway so you can think of you get

267
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,230
thrown an idea and there's some

268
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,940
probability that that will Co activate

269
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,370
other ideas and if it Co activates many

270
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,290
other ideas that's like fluency and if

271
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,509
it co activates ideas that are quite

272
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:14,399
distant from the original idea something

273
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,340
like that and you could you could track

274
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,019
distance by comparing it to to

275
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,879
probability that other people have

276
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,919
generated it then that's also another

277
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,950
indication of creativity so they have to

278
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,699
be unlikely many unlikely responses that

279
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,350
are useful

280
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,030
that's what creativity is roughly

281
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,830
speaking and then you can tracks innate

282
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,000
it in two different dimensions so that's

283
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,800
creative thinking

284
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,289
but then creative achievement would be

285
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,879
the ability to take those original ideas

286
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:40,319
and then actually to implement them in

287
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,090
the world and that's obviously much more

288
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,050
different than merely being creative and

289
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,430
so and then what creativity is depends

290
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:49,529
on which of those measurement routes

291
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,299
that you take now I developed a

292
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,750
questionnaire it's one of my students

293
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,459
Shelley Carson about Jesus just about 30

294
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,259
years ago now 20 years ago I guess

295
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,940
called the creative achievement

296
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,370
questionnaire and I'll show you that

297
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,490
here and I'll show you some of the

298
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,409
things that are interesting about it you

299
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,029
know you hear very frequently people say

300
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:11,669
things like everyone's creative it's

301
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,049
like that's wrong okay it's wrong it's

302
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,849
just as wrong as saying that everyone's

303
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,469
extroverted first of all you have to be

304
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,210
pretty damn smart to be creative because

305
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,139
otherwise you're just going to get to

306
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,509
where other people have

307
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,899
already got and that's not creative by

308
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,220
definition so so being fast and being

309
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,389
out there at the front of things really

310
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,009
makes a difference and then you also

311
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,808
have to have these divergent thinking

312
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,850
capabilities and that's part of your

313
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:34,318
trait structure and creative people are

314
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,629
really different than non creative

315
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,479
people you know partly because for

316
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,528
example they're highly motivated to do

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,619
creative things and to experience

318
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:45,568
novelty in two and two and to chase down

319
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,309
aesthetic experiences in to attend

320
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:50,039
movies and to read fiction and to go to

321
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,958
museums and to enjoy poetry and and and

322
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,009
to enjoy music that's not conventional

323
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,858
music for example

324
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:58,168
these aren't trivial differences and so

325
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:00,119
and so it's a real it's a real myth

326
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:02,188
statement to make the proposition that

327
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,809
everyone's creative it's just simply not

328
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,759
the case it's a matter of wishful

329
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:07,019
thinking it's like saying that everyone

330
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,609
is intelligent it's like well if

331
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,039
everyone is intelligent and then the

332
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:12,569
term loses all of its meaning because

333
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,578
any term that you can apply to every

334
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:17,458
member of a category has absolutely no

335
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,568
meaning now that doesn't and you know

336
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,159
the other thing you want to be thinking

337
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,599
about here is that don't be thinking

338
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,078
that creativity is such a good thing

339
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,489
it's a high-risk high-return strategy so

340
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,078
if you're creative you just try this

341
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,459
there's creative people in this room man

342
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,498
you guys are going to have a hell of a

343
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,479
time monetizing your creativity it's

344
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:35,489
virtually impossible it's really really

345
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,110
difficult because first of all let's say

346
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:39,089
you make an original product you think

347
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,318
the world will beat a pathway to your

348
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,360
door if you build a better mousetrap

349
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:45,149
it's like that's complete rubbish it

350
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,249
isn't it isn't true in the least if you

351
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,159
make a good creative product you've

352
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:52,290
probably solved about 5% of your problem

353
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,999
because then you have marketing which is

354
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,828
insanely difficult and then you have

355
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,909
sales and then you have customer support

356
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:59,668
and then you have to build an

357
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:01,139
organization and you have to if it's

358
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:03,418
really novel you have to tell people

359
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,889
what the hell the thing is you know we

360
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:07,409
built this future authoring program

361
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,839
right and so it's available for people

362
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,308
online how do you market that no one

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,049
knows what that is and that's a real

364
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:14,249
problem if you wrote a book well then

365
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:15,899
you have the problem that another

366
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,428
million people have also written a book

367
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,839
but if you produce something that's

368
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:20,879
completely new and doesn't have a

369
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,039
category people can't search for it

370
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,989
online how are they going to find it so

371
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:27,869
you just have and then you have pricing

372
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:29,939
problems and it's really unbelievably

373
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,100
difficult to produce something creative

374
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:32,990
and then monetize it and even worse if

375
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,240
you're the creative

376
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,889
let's say you have a spectacular

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,029
invention you've got no money right

378
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,189
you've got no customers

379
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,990
those are big problems and so maybe you

380
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,250
go and you find a venture capitalist we

381
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,779
start with family and friends because

382
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,129
that's how it works you raise money for

383
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,169
your product you raise money from your

384
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,820
family and friends that's assuming you

385
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,529
have family and friends that have some

386
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,090
money and that they're going to give it

387
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,159
to you and most people aren't in that

388
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,840
situation so it's a terrible barrier

389
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,129
right off the bat and then of course

390
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,200
you're putting your family and friends

391
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,240
it's substantial financial risk because

392
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,650
the probability that your stupid idea is

393
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,960
going to make money is virtually zero

394
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,029
even if it's a really brilliant idea and

395
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,470
so then let's say well you get past

396
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,449
family and friends and you get venture

397
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,550
capitalist capitalists involved because

398
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,950
that's often the next step or an angel

399
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,659
investor that's there's their steps in

400
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,090
building a business family and friends

401
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:21,980
angel investor that's some rich guy that

402
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,139
you happen to meet some manner in some

403
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,820
way who's who's into this sort of thing

404
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,529
and is willing to provide you with some

405
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,590
money to get your product off the ground

406
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:33,529
well how much of your product is that

407
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,200
person going to take well most of it

408
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:38,149
most of it and then if you get a venture

409
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,009
and no wonder because you know you don't

410
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,659
have any money how are you going to

411
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,549
bargain for control over your product

412
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,240
he'll just say well do you want the

413
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,490
money or not

414
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,080
and if your answer is no then he'll go

415
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,659
and do something else with his money

416
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,280
it's not like there's no shortage of

417
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,839
things that you can do with your money

418
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,069
because there's a million things you can

419
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,139
do with it so you're not in a great

420
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,520
bargaining position and then if you get

421
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,049
venture capitalists involved they'll

422
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,460
take another big chunk and maybe if

423
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:03,589
they're not very straight with you

424
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,970
they'll just throw you out because maybe

425
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,470
by that point in the company's

426
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,670
development you're nothing but a pain in

427
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,129
the neck because what do you know about

428
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:12,469
marketing and sales and customer service

429
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:14,210
and building an organization and running

430
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,029
a business like you don't have a clue so

431
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,670
why do they need you so even if you're

432
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,409
successful at generating a new idea and

433
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,299
you put it into a business the

434
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:25,429
probability that you as the originator

435
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:28,399
of the of the idea are going to make

436
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:29,989
some money from it is very very low so

437
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,970
don't be thinking that creativity is

438
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,000
such a is such a something you would

439
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,070
want to curse yourself with now you know

440
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,019
it's not all bad because it opens up

441
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,400
avenues of experience for creative

442
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,379
people that aren't available to people

443
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,809
who aren't creative but it definitely is

444
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,399
a high-risk high-return strategy you

445
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,338
know so the overwhelming

446
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,990
probability is that you will fail but a

447
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:55,040
small proportion of creative people

448
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,019
succeed spectacularly and so it's like a

449
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,730
lottery in some sense you're probably

450
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,649
going to lose but if you don't lose you

451
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,360
could win big and that keeps a lot of

452
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,649
creative people going but also they

453
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,028
don't really have much choice in it

454
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,059
because if you're a creative person

455
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:09,769
you're like a fruit tree that's that's

456
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,869
bearing fruit so you don't really have

457
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,850
you can suppress it but it's very bad

458
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,139
for you you know the creative people

459
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,269
I've worked with is if they're not

460
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,449
creative they're miserable so they have

461
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,669
to do it but and and you know there's

462
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,520
real joy and pleasure in it and and the

463
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:27,439
end and and and psychological utility

464
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,509
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

465
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,370
it's an intelligent it's certainly not a

466
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,460
conservative strategy for moving forward

467
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,080
through life so and you know whenever I

468
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,580
talk to people who are creative and you

469
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,139
guys should listen to this because I

470
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,490
know what I'm talking about if you

471
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,559
happen to be creative if you're a

472
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,230
songwriter or another kind of musician

473
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,838
or an artist or or any of the other

474
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,509
number of things that you might be find

475
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,940
a way to make money and then practice

476
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,580
your craft on the side because you will

477
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,020
starve to death otherwise now some for

478
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,330
some of you that won't be true but it's

479
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,708
a tiny minority your best bet is to find

480
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,170
a job that will keep body and soul

481
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:05,029
together and parse off some time that

482
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:07,250
you can pursue your creative things

483
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,539
because then well as a long-term

484
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,549
strategy you medium to long term

485
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:11,959
strategy it's a better one but it's got

486
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,178
incredibly difficult for people

487
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,519
musicians for example it's incredibly

488
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,559
difficult for new musicians to monetize

489
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,400
their their craft even if they're really

490
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,818
really good at it

491
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,189
so it's it's well so anyway so don't be

492
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:26,509
so I say well everyone's not everyone's

493
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,980
not creative and everybody goes oh

494
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,599
that's terrible it's like it's not so

495
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,950
terrible it's not something it's not

496
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,629
self-evident that you would curse

497
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,289
someone with high levels of creativity

498
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,030
so alright so here's how our creative

499
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,428
achievement questionnaire works what we

500
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:42,799
did essentially was we thought up how

501
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,500
many domains there are in which you

502
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,669
might be creative and this is remember

503
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,109
when you're designing a questionnaire

504
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,580
you want to be over-inclusive because

505
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,709
the statistics will take care of it

506
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:55,789
right so you can you can take a big area

507
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,190
of potential you can take a large area

508
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,119
and aim your questionnaire at it and you

509
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,490
can do statistics post talk to see

510
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,750
you're covering the area if if the

511
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,579
things that you're measuring are nicely

512
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,929
correlated they're this you know there's

513
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:08,579
something about them that's similar if

514
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,048
they're not correlated then maybe you're

515
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,548
measuring two different things and you

516
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,589
can get rid of one of them that's fine

517
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,960
so we did start with a pretty wide range

518
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:18,569
we thought okay well what domains can

519
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,120
you be creative in visual arts painting

520
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,500
and sculpture then we had experts sort

521
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,928
of rank order levels of achievement

522
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,298
within those domains and so if you are a

523
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,009
painter you can 0 gives you I have no

524
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,750
training or recognised talent in this

525
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:34,169
area okay so you really want to keep an

526
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,000
eye on the zeros alright so then I have

527
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:38,549
taken lessons people have commented on

528
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,470
my talents I have won a prize my work is

529
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:43,490
being critiqued in national publications

530
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,690
all right so you get you get you get

531
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,819
zero to seven points but you can

532
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,100
indicate more than no maybe that's

533
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,129
happened to you more than once so and

534
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:55,379
what happens this is interesting is that

535
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,059
higher you are up in this hierarchy the

536
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,440
more likely it is that those things have

537
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,389
happened to you more than once and

538
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,250
that's that's another example of this

539
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,669
weird thing called the Pareto principle

540
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,589
or Prices law which is that it's sort of

541
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,090
good things happen to you the

542
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:11,730
probability that more good things will

543
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:13,199
happen increases right so because once

544
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,460
you're famous people give you all sorts

545
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,069
of opportunities to do other things

546
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,470
right so your your your success doesn't

547
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:22,740
go like this goes like this zero zero

548
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,778
zero skyrocket that's how it works but

549
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,028
getting from zero getting from zero to

550
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:28,589
one if you're starting a business the

551
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:30,000
hardest customer you'll ever get is your

552
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,379
first one and then the second hardest

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,119
one will be your second one it's

554
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,649
virtually impossible to get a first

555
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,178
customer because they're going to say to

556
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:37,229
you first of all you're going to be

557
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,538
selling to people who are basically

558
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,250
conservative and there aren't going to

559
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,558
be evaluate they're not going to be

560
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,058
willing or able to evaluate whether your

561
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,379
damn product is good for anything and so

562
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,599
they'll say well who are your other

563
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,370
customers and if your answer to that is

564
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,869
well we don't have any it's like well

565
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:54,449
then what they're going to be the first

566
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:55,589
one no because people don't stick their

567
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,558
necks out at all

568
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:00,629
not a bit ever and so unless you're well

569
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,918
established in the market especially if

570
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,390
you're dealing with a big company you

571
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,149
can just bloody well forget it it's like

572
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,100
a three year sales cycle anyways it's

573
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:09,750
RIT because big corporations move very

574
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,279
very slowly and you might be able to

575
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,720
find a small company that doesn't have

576
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,259
much money who would be willing to use

577
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
your stoop

578
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,980
product for nothing if you're really

579
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,219
nice to them and you get one customer

580
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,650
that way it's very very difficult and so

581
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,029
you'll you'll end up you know and what

582
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,460
do you think the royalty just out of

583
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,109
curiosity so I've written a book it's

584
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,910
going to be published by penguin Random

585
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:31,409
House and in January what do you think

586
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,840
the royalty is for an author on a book

587
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,370
so you make something creative you get a

588
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,299
percentage of the sale what do you think

589
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:43,049
the percentage is just out of curiosity

590
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:45,450
guess yeah it's like 5% so think about

591
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:47,819
that so that means that you make your

592
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,170
thing and 95% of it belongs to someone

593
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,849
else and that's that things are going

594
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,350
quite well for you and it doesn't really

595
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,689
matter what you manufacture or produce

596
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:57,359
that's about what you can expect sales

597
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,480
marketing distribution it eats it all up

598
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,859
so us all well anyways you need to know

599
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,089
these things because they're not

600
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,009
self-evident okay

601
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:09,329
so seems to be working all by itself

602
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:11,220
all right so let's take a look well how

603
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:13,109
else can you have creative achievement

604
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,180
well you can be a musician I have no

605
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:16,589
training or recognize Talent recordings

606
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,390
of my composition have been sold

607
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,919
publicly that's the top end my

608
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,110
composition has been copyrighted

609
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,210
recorded critiqued in local population

610
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,789
publication I have composed an original

611
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,990
piece of music well let's try this how

612
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:31,259
many of you have composed an original

613
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,579
piece of music wow there's lots of

614
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,799
creative people in here that's very

615
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,289
impressive so there must be 10 or 11

616
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,349
people in here oh that's cool so how

617
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:43,920
about your coffees composition has been

618
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,169
copyrighted how about it's been the

619
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,060
recordings have been sold publicly and

620
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,890
actually sold how many people - two okay

621
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,629
well so what you can see is there's a

622
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,700
rapid drop-off in the number of people

623
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,500
who say yes how many of you fit into

624
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,340
category zero I have no training a

625
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,009
recognised talent in this area yeah okay

626
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:07,230
okay zero is the median score on all of

627
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,180
these median is the score that's the

628
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,069
most likely for people to have or it's

629
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,140
different than the mean median score is

630
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,279
zero so what's the median score and the

631
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,150
entire creative achievement

632
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,099
questionnaire zero you you add up all

633
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,100
over all thirteen domains the most

634
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,859
difficult score is zero so that's how

635
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,009
creative people are there's zero

636
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,449
creative

637
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:37,930
at all yes everybody has a certain

638
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:39,850
degree not really creative well the

639
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,100
thing is you could say that people have

640
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:44,109
people all people are creative and that

641
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,279
all people can generate ideas but the

642
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:46,659
issue isn't whether or not you can

643
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,190
generate ideas it's whether or not you

644
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,420
can generate ideas that are different

645
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,190
from the ideas that other people

646
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,320
generate that's the critical issue

647
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,750
because it mean it depends on how you

648
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,909
define it you could you well the novelty

649
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,289
is a huge part of it but that's that's

650
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,910
sort of built into the definition of

651
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,339
creative it has to be novel and useful

652
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,930
and if your idea that you generate is

653
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,879
the same as the idea that a bunch of

654
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,650
other people have it's not it's an idea

655
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,660
fair enough and if you define creativity

656
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,009
that way then everyone's creative but

657
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,290
it's a foolish way of defining

658
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:16,809
creativity because everyone does it and

659
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:22,509
and we know that there has to be

660
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:25,839
something novel about creativity useful

661
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:28,569
idea today the Integra's all seem to be

662
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,659
artistic and well as requiring specific

663
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:38,169
non-creative skills for example music

664
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:40,750
and require yeah are there ways to be

665
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,130
creative outside there well let's go

666
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,559
through the rest of the domains because

667
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,480
we did include domains that aren't that

668
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,669
aren't artistic and yes there are

669
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,069
engineering is a good example of that or

670
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,900
writing nonfiction that those things

671
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:55,149
tend to tilt more in the intellect

672
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,400
direction but I'm concentrating most

673
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,410
particularly here on sort of creativity

674
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,090
that would be associated with openness

675
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,710
so yeah okay so dance well it's roughly

676
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,720
the same as music so we won't we won't

677
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,600
move forward into that architectural

678
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,339
design my architectural design my

679
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,869
architectural design has been recognized

680
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:15,309
in the national publication Creative

681
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,129
Writing my work has been reviewed in

682
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,769
national publications million books sold

683
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,530
last year 250 of them sold more than

684
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:26,049
100,000 copies right so that's another

685
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,450
that's another example of high risk high

686
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:30,639
returns so probably you won't write a

687
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,250
book if you write a book probably no one

688
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,230
will publish it if you publish it almost

689
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,509
certainly no one will buy it

690
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,490
so you see you see what I mean there's

691
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,750
exclusion the exclusion criteria there

692
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,419
are so there's so

693
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,798
thoroughly they're so difficult because

694
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:47,049
it's very difficult to write a book even

695
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,720
a bad one you have to work a long time

696
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:51,668
to write a bad book and then your book

697
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,558
has to be pretty damn good before you're

698
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:55,210
going to get it published and and you

699
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,950
also have to know about know how to go

700
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,690
about getting it published that's also

701
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,400
you don't send a book to a publisher by

702
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,429
the way they don't want your stupid book

703
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,620
they want a summary of the book they

704
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,480
want an outline of the book they want

705
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,979
three chapters of the book they want to

706
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,630
know who the hell you are and why anyone

707
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,000
should listen to you they want to know

708
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,309
what other books your book is like and

709
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,259
most importantly perhaps they want to

710
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:19,450
know where it would sit in a bookshelf

711
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,788
in a bookstore and the reason for that

712
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,440
is that and I have trouble this is

713
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:25,179
trouble with the books that I write is

714
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,710
no one was where to put them that's a

715
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,090
big problem because then the marketing

716
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,319
people don't know how to market them and

717
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:31,149
maybe that's because they're more

718
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,619
creative than usual it doesn't matter if

719
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,480
there isn't a place that you can put the

720
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,099
book where people can find it then

721
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,630
you're not going to publish it and even

722
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:39,399
if you do you can't sell it because no

723
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,960
one can find it so you just think about

724
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,850
the difficulties and being a successful

725
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,220
author you're not going to write a book

726
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:46,538
it's too hard there's no damn way you're

727
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,620
going to get it published and if you do

728
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:49,480
it probably won't be a very good

729
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,189
publisher then they have to do a really

730
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,980
good job of selling it and marketing it

731
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,558
then you have to enter the market at the

732
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,150
right time right and then you have to be

733
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,889
reviewed by the right people and then it

734
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,929
has to be put in the right places it's

735
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,880
like most what happens is your book will

736
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:05,530
go out for a week no one will buy it and

737
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,870
it'll disappear and that's if you've

738
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:14,168
done 99.99% of things right so okay

739
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:15,548
creative writing our humor my humor has

740
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,049
been recognized in a national

741
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:18,668
publication that's at the top and I've

742
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:20,048
written a joke or cartoon that has been

743
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,000
published I've written jokes for other

744
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:24,730
people I've worked as a professional

745
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,650
comedian inventions I regularly find

746
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,298
novel uses for household objects I've

747
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,220
built a prototype of one of my designed

748
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:31,900
inventions I've sold one of my

749
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,640
inventions to people I know has anyone

750
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:41,230
in here built a prototype of a designed

751
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:44,309
invention no one okay has anyone in here

752
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:48,909
created original software for a computer

753
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:51,940
one to three people yes three people how

754
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:54,700
about I've sketched out an invention and

755
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,090
worked on design flaws how many people

756
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,889
so maybe two or three yeah I mean if

757
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,329
this was an engineering class and all

758
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:03,248
likelihood there would be more people in

759
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:05,230
not telling but that this is more in the

760
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:07,118
domain it's not the exactly the artsy

761
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,849
end of the creativity distribution it's

762
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:11,709
more on the ideas and and mechanical end

763
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:13,888
of it and and and that's a reasonable

764
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,829
way of thinking about it I would say so

765
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:19,388
um scientific discovery I do not have

766
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:21,759
training or recognizability in this

767
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:23,349
field I received a scholarship based on

768
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,970
my work in science or medicine how many

769
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:27,839
people have received a scholarship based

770
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,190
in their work on science and medicine

771
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,898
okay nobody so we don't have anybody

772
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,159
that goes up that high I've won a prize

773
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:36,579
at a science fair or other local

774
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,679
competition anybody there yes there's

775
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:40,239
maybe two or three four people there so

776
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:45,340
that means we've got four people in the

777
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:47,350
class of about 150 who hit the third the

778
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:49,209
second level of scientific discovery

779
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:51,009
anybody received a grant to pursue their

780
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,450
work in science and medicine its highly

781
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,788
unlikely you guys are mostly too young

782
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:59,440
to have had that happen to you okay

783
00:27:54,788 --> 00:28:01,480
so theater and film anybody who's at how

784
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,600
many people have performed in theater or

785
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,429
film oh yeah your Narsee bunchy so my

786
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,898
acting abilities have been recognized in

787
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,210
local publication how many people for

788
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:11,618
that one

789
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,358
that's it anybody higher than that I

790
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:14,138
have directed or produced a theater or

791
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,939
film production

792
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:23,258
one two I've been paid there's a good

793
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:26,710
one I have been paid to pit one two two

794
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:29,349
okay my theatrical work has been paid to

795
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:33,879
direct the theater film production ha

796
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:35,439
got you there so you've done that Hey

797
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:39,398
congratulations you're way the hell up

798
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,090
on the list right right right right hard

799
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:45,518
to monetize how many films did you make

800
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:51,519
you made poor did you make any money oh

801
00:28:45,519 --> 00:29:01,558
you did well congratulations yeah yeah

802
00:28:51,519 --> 00:29:01,558
yeah well that's about yeah

803
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,870
yeah calab recruiter and then also

804
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:08,009
piracy got really bad right yeah well

805
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:09,029
that's one of the big problems with

806
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,890
anything that can be distributed

807
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:16,139
digitally it's like yeah yeah yeah I rat

808
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,650
right timing is everything and that's

809
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,299
it's actually well that's that's another

810
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,370
one of the terrible cut offs is that not

811
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:24,900
only do you have to be right and have

812
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:26,308
yourself together and produce the proper

813
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,870
thing but the market has to open it's

814
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,668
exactly that moment so that you can walk

815
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:31,199
through there has to be a demand so

816
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:33,360
people won't buy anything that they

817
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,220
don't have a crying need for because

818
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,839
they have priority say it's imagine

819
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,548
everybody has ten priorities and ten

820
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,349
number ten is important but no one ever

821
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:42,240
does it and number eight is important

822
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:43,980
that no one ever does it and so you have

823
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,169
to go talk to someone to buy what you

824
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,548
have and that has to be priority one or

825
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,020
two for them because they'll say oh

826
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:50,369
that's good we really need it but it's

827
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:51,779
priority eight it's like forget it

828
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:53,308
they'll never buy your thing because

829
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,750
they never get to priority eight on

830
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:57,480
their list of ten priorities they only

831
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,380
get down to like priority four so and

832
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,940
then the other thing that will happen

833
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,770
too is if you go up try to sell your

834
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,269
product you won't know who to talk to

835
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,769
and you'll end up spending ninety five

836
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,139
percent of your time this is especially

837
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:09,929
true in companies with the people who

838
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,980
will talk to you right obviously but

839
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:12,330
those aren't the people who ever make

840
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,130
any decisions so they'll tell you all

841
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,418
sorts of good things about your product

842
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,860
and how interested they are but they'll

843
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,020
never buy it because they can't make

844
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:20,099
make decisions and you won't be able to

845
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,079
get to the people who make decisions

846
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,759
because other people who know how to do

847
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,418
that have already got there and that's

848
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:29,339
not you so that's very difficult as well

849
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:32,970
culinary arts my recipes have been

850
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:35,189
published nationally anyone how about I

851
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,079
often experiment with rest misses

852
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,929
purposeful experimentation right not

853
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,058
accidental experimentation yes sorry

854
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:45,360
alright my recipes would be published in

855
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:47,069
the local cookbook anyone know okay okay

856
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,048
well you get the you get the point right

857
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:50,490
you see you see how this works it's just

858
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:52,950
well here are ways you can be creative

859
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,359
and here are strata of accomplishment

860
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,340
within those ways and so then the

861
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,339
question is what does it look like yes

862
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:05,610
yes yes yes fair enough and and this

863
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:08,339
probably needs to be updated to reflect

864
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,509
that so so there's there's the

865
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,759
distribution of scores

866
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:13,319
now that's dismal that's a dismal thing

867
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,059
to look at you have to understand that

868
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,500
why look at this

869
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:21,240
zero right the median person has not

870
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,970
done anything creative ever in their

871
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,529
life with anything on any dimension

872
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,759
right it's really important to know that

873
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:31,200
and then you have these horrible people

874
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:33,779
out here right they do everything they

875
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,490
do everything price is law here's prices

876
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,440
law this is something to hammer into

877
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,460
your heart the square root of the number

878
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,900
of people in a domain do 50% of the work

879
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,549
okay so let's go through that you have

880
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,130
ten employees three of them do half the

881
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:49,680
work makes sense that's reasonable you

882
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,410
have a hundred employees ten of them do

883
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,289
half the work that's problem so the

884
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,820
other 90% are doing the other half who

885
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,389
cares about them you have 10,000

886
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,740
employees 100 of them do have to work

887
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,970
right so here's that here's a nasty

888
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,440
little law as your company grows

889
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,769
incompetence grows in it exponentially

890
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,990
and confidence grows linearly got it

891
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:14,700
right because it with ten it's three who

892
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,230
are doing half the work but at 10,000

893
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,970
it's 100 that are doing half the work so

894
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,009
nine thousand nine hundred of your

895
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,440
employees are doing as much as the best

896
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:24,900
100 you might not even know who the best

897
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,120
100 are but probably they know and maybe

898
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,440
their peers know too and so one of the

899
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,269
things that's really interesting when

900
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,009
big companies start to shake which means

901
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:33,960
maybe they've had a bad quarter too bad

902
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:36,509
quarters and the stock price starts to

903
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,860
tip down and the people the hot people

904
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,839
who have options are not very happy

905
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,519
about that and maybe they start to

906
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,470
announce layoffs all the hundred people

907
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,119
who have opportunities leave and they're

908
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,650
the ones who were doing half the work so

909
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,089
boy that puts your company in a pretty

910
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,730
rough situation because now you've got

911
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:52,259
the ninety nine hundred people left over

912
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,029
who we're only doing half the work and

913
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,519
the next time you announced layoffs the

914
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:58,319
next most productive hundred leave and

915
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,700
so then you're left with nobody who's

916
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:04,230
productive at a massive overhead payroll

917
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,809
prices law you can look that up to Sol a

918
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,490
price to Sol a price is a guy who is

919
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:10,230
looking at scientific productivity and

920
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,930
one of the things he found was when he

921
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,509
was looking at PhD students is that the

922
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,279
median number of publications for a PhD

923
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:21,089
graduate when he did his work which was

924
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,190
in the early 60s was one okay half as

925
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,500
many had - half as many as that had

926
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,210
three half as many as that had four -

927
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,859
real stepped out and one of the

928
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,850
corollaries of that is that there's a

929
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:31,889
number of people who are hyper

930
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:34,980
productive and that's these people out

931
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,020
here and if you were graphing the

932
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,509
distribution let's say you graphed how

933
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,730
many people in that population of 300

934
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:43,769
had $10,000 in a savings account it

935
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,589
would look very much like this some of

936
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:48,298
them would have are some of some of them

937
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:50,819
would most people would have like no

938
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:52,048
savings whatsoever the median person

939
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:54,269
would have no savings whatsoever and

940
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:55,950
then you go up here where the 1% is they

941
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:58,139
have all the money but the thing you

942
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,880
want to understand about that 1% issue

943
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,820
that you always hear about is that it

944
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,900
applies in every single realm where

945
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,389
there's difference in creative

946
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,190
production every realm doesn't matter

947
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,780
number of Records produce number of

948
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,628
records sold number of compositions

949
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,869
written so here's here's an example 5

950
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:18,659
composers produce the music that

951
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:21,149
occupies 50% of the classical repertoire

952
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,179
by Bach Beethoven Brahms

953
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:26,489
Tchaikovsky who's Mozart that's right

954
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,960
those 5 ok so here's something cool so

955
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:30,658
you take all the music those people

956
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,929
wrote 5 percent of the music all those

957
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,849
people wrote occupies 50 percent of the

958
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,789
music that of their writing that's

959
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:41,159
played so not only do almost all the

960
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:42,869
composers never get a listen but even

961
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,700
among the composers and you get a list

962
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:47,940
and almost none of their music ever gets

963
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,799
played so so then that's that's another

964
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,659
example of this price is law of scaling

965
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,639
so and it applies to all sorts of things

966
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,590
like number of hockey goals scored is

967
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,910
also distributed this way number of

968
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,570
basketball basketball basketball

969
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,269
successfully put through the hoop

970
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,010
follows the same distribution size of

971
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:08,039
cities follows the same distribution

972
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:11,100
it's a weird it's a weird law and you

973
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,699
you can think about it in part why does

974
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,739
this happen

975
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:16,858
law imagine what happens when you play

976
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:18,979
Monopoly what happens everybody has the

977
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:21,389
same amount of money to begin with right

978
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,670
so then you start playing it's basically

979
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:25,108
a random game well some people start to

980
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,180
win a bit some people start to lose a

981
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:28,769
bit and then if you win the probability

982
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:30,839
that you'll keep winning starts to

983
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:32,969
increase and if you lose your

984
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,410
vulnerability increases as you lose and

985
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:36,779
then maybe you've got to say six people

986
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:40,259
play Monopoly soon one person has zero

987
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,970
what happens when they have zero they're

988
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,450
out of the game so zero is a weird

989
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,949
number

990
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:47,098
because when you hit zero you're out of

991
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:48,868
the game so so then if you keep playing

992
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,660
people start to stack up at zero right

993
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:53,490
what happens at the end of the game one

994
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,279
person has all the property and all the

995
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:57,750
money and everyone else has none right

996
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,150
that's what happens if you play an

997
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,338
iterated trading game to its final

998
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,320
conclusion and that's part of the the

999
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:06,659
law in a sense that's underlying this

1000
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,789
kind of distribution so it's it's really

1001
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,949
it's it's it's not a consequence

1002
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,690
necessarily of structural inequality

1003
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:14,730
it's built into the system at a deeper

1004
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,320
level than that so you know people talk

1005
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,630
about all the time about how unfair it

1006
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,059
is that 1% of the population has the

1007
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,730
vast amount of the money and 1% of the

1008
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,759
1% has most of that money and 1% of the

1009
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,429
1% of the 1% has most of that money but

1010
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,710
it is a it's a it's an inevitable

1011
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:33,598
conclusion of iterated trading games and

1012
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,150
we don't know how to fight it we don't

1013
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,070
know how to take from the people who

1014
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,838
have and move it to the bottom without

1015
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,809
instantly moving back up to the top

1016
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,269
different people maybe but still back up

1017
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:48,389
to the top because even the 1% turns a

1018
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:50,369
lot like I think you have a 10% chance

1019
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:52,710
if I remember correctly you have a 10%

1020
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:55,769
chance of being in the top 1% for at

1021
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,230
least one year of your life and a 40%

1022
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:59,880
chance of being in the top 10% for at

1023
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,559
least one year in your life that's in

1024
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,568
Canada in the u.s. it's less so in

1025
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,730
Europe so there's a fair bit of churning

1026
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:07,800
at the top end it's not the same people

1027
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,869
all the time you have the money but it

1028
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:20,369
is a tiny fraction of the people all the

1029
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:24,450
time who have all the money yeah people

1030
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:24,960
inside redistribute to recreate no not

1031
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:27,949
usually

1032
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,670
I mean they do but it's attenuated

1033
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:34,409
because the people mean if you reach up

1034
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,059
the entire company and put everywhere

1035
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:37,230
somewhere else there's some probability

1036
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,789
that some of those people would rise to

1037
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,099
the top that weren't at the top before

1038
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,318
but in that company that that isn't

1039
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:45,680
generally what happens people get stuck

1040
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:48,269
in their niche and they don't move so

1041
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,009
yeah this is you kill you wonder

1042
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:51,838
sometimes well how can companies die so

1043
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,640
quickly well they go they go into a

1044
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,099
death spiral it's almost impossible for

1045
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,779
them to get out of so and it happened

1046
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,789
happen extraordinarily quickly this is

1047
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,740
why you know the typical fortune 500

1048
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:04,050
company only last 30 years that's it

1049
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,869
it's not that easy for these Bale moths

1050
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,100
to continue existance across time so and

1051
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,109
it's because it's really easy for

1052
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,329
something to die it's very unlikely that

1053
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,160
it will be built it's very unlikely that

1054
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:16,079
it will be successful and once

1055
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,759
successful it's very unlikely that it

1056
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,190
will continue to duplicate its success

1057
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,510
because the underlying landscape shifts

1058
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,659
on it and it doesn't know where to go

1059
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,640
and that's also partly because it's not

1060
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:28,769
that easy to integrate creative people

1061
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,000
into your company right you certainly

1062
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,320
don't want them at the bottom because

1063
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,090
they're supposed to be people who are

1064
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,559
doing what they're told to do so you

1065
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,360
filter out a lot of them at the bottom

1066
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,469
and then you need them at the top but

1067
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,840
they've already been filtered out and

1068
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:42,179
also creative people are troublesome to

1069
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,700
work with because they're always how do

1070
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:47,129
you evaluate a creative person you all

1071
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:49,230
you almost can't by definition because

1072
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,640
they keep coming up with new things and

1073
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,500
you don't have a good evaluative

1074
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,179
strategy for a new thing it wouldn't be

1075
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,590
new if you had a good evaluative

1076
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,359
strategy for it right it would have to

1077
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,430
be the member of a class that you've

1078
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,500
already encountered substantially so

1079
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:07,379
anyway so the take-home lesson from this

1080
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:09,570
is zero right right and then that's like

1081
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,490
that's like a graph of money monetary

1082
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,809
distribution as well and the thing the

1083
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,119
problem with being at zero is it's very

1084
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,130
difficult to get out of zero this is

1085
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,779
also why people get stuck in poverty you

1086
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,400
know you can't get a bank account if

1087
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,250
you're if you don't have any money right

1088
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,809
if there's a bunch of things that start

1089
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,360
to move against you when you're at zero

1090
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:29,539
that you can't shake it's very difficult

1091
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,579
to get out of the to get out of the that

1092
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:38,759
the pit here because zero is a kind of

1093
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,869
pit okay so now we've got the creative

1094
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,220
achievement questionnaire and we're

1095
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:43,109
going to take your score and your score

1096
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,269
is summed across all the categories and

1097
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,160
and and all the exemplars of the

1098
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:49,409
categories that you've chosen so then

1099
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,779
the question is well can you predict

1100
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:54,059
creative achievement and and this is

1101
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,680
this is this is how we did it with this

1102
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,719
was construct delegation the first thing

1103
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,129
we wanted to know was was the creative

1104
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:00,569
achievement questionnaire actually

1105
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,630
associated with something that you might

1106
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:07,950
regard as creativity okay so we got a

1107
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:09,539
number of students to come in and we

1108
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:11,609
gave them a collage kit

1109
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,289
and so then everybody got exactly the

1110
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,269
same tip and then we had to make a

1111
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:17,550
collage out of the collage kit then we

1112
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:19,949
have five artists rate the collage for

1113
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,510
quality and then we averaged across the

1114
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,919
ratings now the first thing you would do

1115
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,290
if you did that is because you would

1116
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,680
might think well can artists actually

1117
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:30,690
come up with a a measure of how creative

1118
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,599
a collage is and the answer to that is

1119
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,670
actually technical if all say you guys

1120
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,309
are the panel if all of you identify the

1121
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,619
same collages as of high quality and the

1122
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:42,539
same ones as of low quality then we can

1123
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,849
assume that there's something about your

1124
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,590
judgement that's like independent of

1125
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,750
your idiosyncrasies we could say well

1126
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,700
there is a judgment that emerges as a

1127
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,889
consensus across artists and the first

1128
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:56,129
thing we found was that there was there

1129
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:58,980
is quite a high correlation between each

1130
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:00,420
artists judgment of the quality of the

1131
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,949
collages I can't remember what the

1132
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,590
inter-rater reliability was but it was

1133
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:06,509
something like 0.8 it was really high so

1134
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,370
it was clear that trained artists could

1135
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,290
make reliable judgments about the

1136
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,480
quality of collages because you had to

1137
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:13,710
check that out first because if they're

1138
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,329
all over the place you got no measure

1139
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,820
right it's like everyone's using a

1140
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:19,529
different rulers got no measure so they

1141
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,960
have to be using the same ruler well we

1142
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:24,360
found that the correlation between the

1143
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,750
creative evaluation of collages and the

1144
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,370
total taq was 0.59 which is

1145
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:32,190
mind-boggling I told you last time that

1146
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:36,199
under 5% of published social studies

1147
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:39,179
social science studies have a are

1148
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,429
demonstrate a correlation coefficient of

1149
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:45,000
an effect size greater than 0.5 this is

1150
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:46,589
0.6 and if you if you square it point 5

1151
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,659
squared is 25 percent of the variance

1152
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,970
point 6 squared is 36 percent of the

1153
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:53,429
variance point 6 is a lot more than 0.5

1154
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:55,919
and point 5 is unheard of and so the

1155
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:58,829
fact that you could estimate someone's

1156
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,500
lifetime creative achievement by having

1157
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:03,210
them do a collage that for artists rape

1158
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,829
was an indication that there really is

1159
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,800
something real at the bottom of it right

1160
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:10,019
that's like the definition of real the

1161
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,120
creative personality scale you use

1162
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:13,949
circle adjectives that are associated

1163
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,509
with creativity from a very large list

1164
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:17,549
of adjectives that work pretty well

1165
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,080
Goldberg's adjective markers that's

1166
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,900
another Big Five variant that was

1167
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,420
correlated at about 0.5 1 it doesn't

1168
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,289
measure

1169
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,500
to experience it just measures intellect

1170
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:31,539
but be that as it may it's still an

1171
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,298
personality marker of trade openness it

1172
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:37,179
was correlated at 0.5 won the Neel PIR

1173
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:39,309
openness was correlated at 0.33 and then

1174
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:41,139
we use the divergent thinking tests and

1175
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,819
I told you about those already's how

1176
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:45,009
many uses can you think of for a brick

1177
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:46,838
for example and so those are scored

1178
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:48,490
according to fluency how many answers

1179
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:50,798
you provide and then also originality

1180
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,838
how many unique useful answers do you

1181
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:56,199
provide and that was nicely correlated

1182
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:59,230
as well overall correlation of 0.47 and

1183
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:02,649
then fluency 0.38 originality 0.46 and

1184
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,510
flexibility point 3 7 so so what does

1185
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:08,048
that mean well the creative achievement

1186
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:09,520
questionnaire indexes lifetime creative

1187
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:11,199
achievement in a way that's powerfully

1188
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,269
associated with actual creative

1189
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,179
production of a single item plus

1190
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:19,030
creative creativity as it's indexed by

1191
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:20,980
personality markers on the C IQ is also

1192
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,829
potently predicted by IQ which is

1193
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,358
exactly what you'd expect so you can do

1194
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:27,339
an extraordinarily good job of

1195
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,289
determining how likely someone is to

1196
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,818
have high levels of creative achievement

1197
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,440
across their lifespan by using

1198
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:34,358
psychometric tests so it means that

1199
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,700
creativity is a real thing that's the

1200
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:38,619
first thing both in terms of thinking

1201
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:40,929
creatively that would be the divergent

1202
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:42,640
thinking tests and also in terms of

1203
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:43,899
creative production and and that

1204
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,449
creative production and creative

1205
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,190
thinking are quite tightly aligned so

1206
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:49,838
that was good that's been a very

1207
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,329
influential paper I think it's got about

1208
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,710
500 citations now people use the

1209
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,359
creative achievement questionnaire a lot

1210
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,220
to assess creativity it's also

1211
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,679
associated with a higher than average

1212
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:01,179
likelihood of psychosis and the other

1213
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,348
thing you see with creative people is

1214
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:04,568
that they tend especially if they're

1215
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,400
writers they tend the pathology that

1216
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:08,440
goes along with that is often manic

1217
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,910
depressive disorder and that's partly

1218
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,240
because manic people become unbelievably

1219
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:15,368
fluid I think they speak incredibly

1220
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,279
quickly they generate ideas like mad and

1221
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:20,380
it's a hyper arousal of the positive

1222
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,960
emotion system roughly speaking and that

1223
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,960
can have as a side effect creativity so

1224
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,480
this is a cool study I just found this

1225
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,700
one today it's a terror management study

1226
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,170
so what I'll read it to you the

1227
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,009
relationship between creativity and

1228
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,780
symbolic

1229
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,030
mortality had been long acknowledged by

1230
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,519
scholars in the review of the literature

1231
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,750
we found 12 papers that empirically

1232
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,480
examined the relationship between

1233
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,130
creativity and mortality awareness using

1234
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,869
a terror management theory paradigm

1235
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,670
overall supporting the notion that

1236
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:53,710
creativity plays an important role in

1237
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:57,070
the management of existential concerns

1238
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,480
also a mini meta-analysis of the impact

1239
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,430
of death awareness on creativity

1240
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,590
resulted in a small medium weighted mean

1241
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:04,239
effect we examine the existential

1242
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,220
buffering functions of creative

1243
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,809
achievement as assessed by the creative

1244
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:11,289
achievement questionnaire in a sample of

1245
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:13,090
108 students at high but not low levels

1246
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:16,349
of creative goals creative achievement

1247
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:18,490
was associated with lower death thought

1248
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:20,349
accessibility under mortality salience

1249
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:22,750
well that means if you remind people

1250
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:24,250
that they're going to die the creative

1251
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,679
people were less likely to generate

1252
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,239
death related thoughts as a consequence

1253
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:30,069
to our knowledge this is the first

1254
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,869
empirical report of the anxiety

1255
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,250
buffering functions of a creative

1256
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:35,109
achievement among people for whom

1257
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,809
creativity constitutes a central part of

1258
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,099
the cultural worldview it's like a

1259
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:40,539
empirical examination of some of the

1260
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:42,429
existential theories that I was

1261
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,739
presenting to you previously because

1262
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:46,179
part of the idea that was put forth to

1263
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:48,189
say by people like Nietzsche was that

1264
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:50,259
one of the ways to fight back against

1265
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,780
existential anxiety and death anxiety

1266
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,400
and all of that is to engage in creative

1267
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,620
production and so that was actually put

1268
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,670
to the empirical test in this study so I

1269
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,670
thought that was quite cool

1270
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,329
so there's another paper this was by

1271
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,430
Kaufmann and a couple of my students

1272
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:15,009
Jacob Hirsch and Colin Dion I'm on that

1273
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:18,190
paper as well near the end there they

1274
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:20,500
were interested in whether openness and

1275
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:22,119
intellect predicted different elements

1276
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,739
of creative achievements or goes back to

1277
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:25,719
your question about the differentiation

1278
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:29,979
between the artsy end of creativity and

1279
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:32,349
maybe the more practical idiot and the

1280
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,750
practical end associated for example

1281
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:36,250
with the proclivity to like nonfiction

1282
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:40,570
the Big Five personality dimension

1283
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:42,369
openness / intellect is the trait most

1284
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,500
closely associated with creativity and

1285
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:46,569
creative achievement little is known

1286
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,579
however regarding the discriminant

1287
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:52,360
validity of its two aspects discriminant

1288
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:54,039
validity is whether one aspect predicts

1289
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,539
one set of things and the other aspect

1290
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:57,699
predicts a different set of things if

1291
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:59,230
there's no discriminant validity if they

1292
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:01,359
can't be used for different purposes

1293
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,889
then there's no point having them so you

1294
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,630
want to see that they're actually

1295
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:09,309
capable of differentiating between

1296
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:12,420
between real world phenomena two of its

1297
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:12,420
aspects openness to experience

1298
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,049
reflecting cognitive engagement with

1299
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:20,019
perception fantasy aesthetics and

1300
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:22,000
emotions and intellect reflecting

1301
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:24,130
cognitive engagement with abstract and

1302
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,010
semantic information primarily through

1303
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,200
reasoning in relation to creativity in

1304
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,570
four demographically diverse samples

1305
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,339
totaling over a thousand participants we

1306
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:35,320
investigated the independent predictive

1307
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,030
validity of openness and intellect by

1308
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,950
assessing the relations among cognitive

1309
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,900
ability divergent thinking personality

1310
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:44,829
and creative achievement across the Arts

1311
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,300
and Sciences we confirm that hypothesis

1312
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:50,259
that openness predicts creative

1313
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:52,390
achievement in the arts and intellect

1314
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,220
predicts creative achievement in the

1315
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:55,960
sciences inclusion of performance

1316
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:58,889
measures of general cognitive ability

1317
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,880
that's IQ and divergent thinking

1318
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:02,769
indicated that the relationship of

1319
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,000
intellect to scientific creativity may

1320
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,980
be due at least in part to these

1321
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,730
abilities lastly we found that

1322
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,110
extraversion

1323
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,150
additionally predicted creative

1324
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,329
achievement in the arts independently of

1325
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,590
openness so what that means is that

1326
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:16,289
creative achievement in the arts is

1327
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,750
actually a function of

1328
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:20,789
higher-order trait plasticity right

1329
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,610
because plasticity was openness plus

1330
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:24,960
extraversion and that's associated

1331
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,730
fundamentally with activation of the

1332
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,409
underlying dopaminergic system which is

1333
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:31,110
the system that mediates exploratory

1334
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:32,879
behavior so if you're dominated by that

1335
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,950
the function of that system

1336
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,440
you're an exploratory gregarious person

1337
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:41,179
then you're more likely to manifest

1338
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:45,630
creative ability in the arts so

1339
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:47,549
apparently it's time stop yeah I think

1340
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:53,269
that's the same student who always does

1341
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:53,269
that alright we'll see you on Tuesday

1342
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,010

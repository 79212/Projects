1
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:18,030
this one's particularly complicated so because with Piaget you enter a whole

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,070
new domain of of axiomatic thinking that's the right way to think about it

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,640
say each of these people that were discussing each of these theories comes

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,769
out the construction of the world from a different perspective and it's it's

5
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,679
really fundamentally different it's different way deep down at the level of

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,630
fundamental assumptions and so Piaget who's a who's probably the world's most

7
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,230
famous developmental psychologist but although he didn't consider himself a

8
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:46,320
developmental psychologist he considered himself a genetic epistemology and what

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,049
that meant was that he was interested in Paestum ology which is how knowledge

10
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:54,699
structures work and genetic means formulation of and so he was interested

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,480
in how children formulate their knowledge structures in the world and he

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:05,649
was a constructivist because he believed that human beings construct the they

13
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,310
don't only construct the representations of the world and it's deeper than that

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,810
it's more like they construct the world itself now it depends to some degree on

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,490
what you think of as the world and of course that's so there's a reality

16
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:20,259
definition issue that's nested at the bottom of this and it's a very complex

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,680
one and so I'm going to have to walk you through it piece by piece now Piaget was

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,860
a genius he was he wrote a paper I believe on mollusks when he was ten and

19
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,510
had it published in a scientific journal and he was offered the curatorship of a

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,159
museum as a consequence of that and his parents had to write the museum

21
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,870
directors and tell them that he couldn't curate the museum because he was only

22
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,770
ten and so that gives you some idea about Piaget and he's published many

23
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:49,478
many many books and many of them haven't been translated into English yet and so

24
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:56,890
he was quite the he was quite the you know large intelligence creature and he

25
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,560
studied all sorts of things so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,000
constructivism I'm gonna start with a quote from Piaget and it's uh it's he's

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,669
some book some of his books I found quite straightforward and some of them

28
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,559
very difficult and I think it's often because of the quality of the

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,140
translation this happens to be a relatively difficult section I don't

30
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,229
think it's translated that well but whatever we're going to go through it

31
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,348
I'll explain it to you a little bit so Piaget said the common postulate that's

32
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,479
assumption of various traditional epistemology

33
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,278
theories of valid knowledge is that knowledge itself is a fact

34
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:34,979
and not a process and then if our various forms of knowledge are always

35
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,719
incomplete and our various science is still imperfect that which is acquired

36
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,090
is still acquired and can therefore be studied statically hence the absolute

37
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,278
position of the problems what is knowledge or how are the various types

38
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:51,729
of knowledge possible under the converging influence of a series of

39
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,289
factors we're tending more and more today to regard knowledge as a process

40
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:00,259
more than a state any being or object that Sciences attempts to hold fast

41
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:04,649
dissolves once again in the current of development it is the last analysis of

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,180
this development and of it alone that we have the right to state it is a fact

43
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,510
what we can and should then seek is the law of this process quotes we are well

44
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,870
aware on the other hand of the fine book by kuhn on scientific revolutions now

45
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,069
there is an awful lot of information in that paragraph so we'll unpack it a

46
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:28,108
little bit before we go on now one way of looking at science is that it's a

47
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,159
collection of facts right that's that's what Piaget is stating to begin with and

48
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,289
that we assume that the facts that science has gathered are facts and

49
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,278
Static but if you observe them across time what you find is that scientific

50
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:44,419
facts tend to shift and transform because scientific theories that are

51
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,649
applicable in one century let's say turn out to be less applicable in the next

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,069
now there's been a lot of argument and discussion about this because the fact

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,608
that facts change seems to indicate that they're not so self-evidently fact and

54
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:06,209
there are people and perhaps Kuhn would be among them who believe that science

55
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,348
consisted of the juxtaposition of paradigms so those are sets of axioms

56
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:15,598
within which something operates and the paradigms he considered them often in

57
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,149
commensurate you couldn't move from one to another because the axioms were

58
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,859
different there was no necessary no what what might you say there was no

59
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,850
necessary means of communication between them but and and and Piaget knew of

60
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,900
Thomas Kuhns work that's the scientists structure of scientific revolutions

61
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:35,669
which was published in 1962 it's a classic text in the philosophy of

62
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,319
science and and what Piaget soon more was more like a I would say

63
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,709
more like a classic view of science where so for example when Newton came up

64
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,209
with Newtonian physics there was a set of propositions upon which Newtonian

65
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,769
physics was based and then when Einstein transformed those propositions what

66
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,719
happened was that Newtonian physics became a subset of Einsteinian physics

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,280
and so the way that Piaget looked at the development of factual ideas at least in

68
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,019
part was that you'd come up with a set of ideas that were facts and then that

69
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,529
would be superseded by a different theory within that within which that

70
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,949
original theory would be nested and so that what happens that each theory in

71
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,339
some sense although it transforms it becomes more complete as the scientific

72
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,599
progression continues now Kuhn didn't precisely believe that although exactly

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,379
what Kuhn meant by a paradigm shift because Kuhn originated that term isn't

74
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,219
clear but he didn't seem to actually believe that science had this capacity

75
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,660
to present a series of facts and then alter the underlying presuppositions and

76
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,790
then to nest that within a broader series of facts like you would assume if

77
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,930
you were thinking about the relationship between Newton and Einstein

78
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,490
so Newtonian physics is a subset of einsteinium physics so now that's kind

79
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,579
of how Piaget thought about how human beings developed knowledge he believed

80
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:59,279
that we came up with well let's say you wanted to chop down a tree that might be

81
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,500
a good example I mean you could use a dull axe made of bronze and it's like

82
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,209
well that would chop down the tree it'd be a lot of work though and then maybe

83
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,149
you replace that with a sharp steel axe that's designed like a wedge so that you

84
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,859
can really hack down a tree with it or maybe you replace it with a saw and so

85
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,889
the it's not like the bronze axe could chop down the tree but the steel axe can

86
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,519
do a better job in the saw can do even a better job and so the way that Piaget

87
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,419
thought about the transformation of human knowledge structures from from

88
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,740
infancy onward essentially was that infants would produce a representation

89
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,400
of the world that was sort of low resolution but quite tool like it would

90
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,819
work in the world but then as they progressed the nature of those tools

91
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,839
would become refined that sometimes transform completely so some sometimes

92
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,379
imagine that a child would use in a sense a low resolution picture of

93
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,819
something and then they would increase its resolution

94
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,159
as they filled in the details that would be assimilation that's the page idea

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,250
notion of assimilation you're using the same basic theory but filling in the

96
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,029
details and then now and then you'd have to switch to another picture entirely

97
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:08,109
and that would be more like accommodation that's where you'd have to

98
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,040
transform your internal structures completely in order to properly

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,870
represent an act within the world and so that's the basic difference between

100
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,639
accommodation and assimilation so assimilation is like micro alterations

101
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,819
and accommodation is transformation of the knowledge structure itself and so

102
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,909
that's part of so what khun pointed out was that there'd be a set of facts and

103
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,320
then there'd be an anomaly arise of some sort so like at the end of the 19th

104
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,790
century the only remaining anomaly was at least one of the remaining anomalies

105
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,270
was that no matter which direction you shine a light beam in and no matter how

106
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,769
fast the platform on which you're standing is moving the light beam has

107
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:49,699
exactly the same velocity which seems impossible so you know if the earth is

108
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,149
moving this way around the Sun and you shine a light off the earth you'd expect

109
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,219
the speed of light to be the speed of light plus the speed of the earth and

110
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,920
then if you shone it the other way then you'd expect the speed of light to be

111
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,050
the speed of light - the earth speed but that isn't what happens no matter how

112
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,850
fast the platform on which the person shining the light is standing the speed

113
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,230
of light is always the same to every observer so and people kind of thought

114
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,470
of that as that wasn't the only anomaly but that was one of them

115
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,010
thought of that is the only anomaly left in physics at the end of the 19th

116
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,329
century and turned out that was a bad one how long there was some other ones

117
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:26,329
as well like the fact that light tends to behave as a wave and a particle more

118
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,319
or less at the same time which doesn't seem possible so there's a couple of

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,769
things left over in Newtonian physics that the Newtonian physics couldn't

120
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,940
explain but by the end of the 19th century there were famous scientists

121
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,440
saying yeah well we got this all wrapped up there's really nothing left to

122
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,479
discover and then Along Came quantum mechanics and Einstein Yin relativity

123
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,950
and bang the whole world was like really different and quantum mechanics is much

124
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,900
more comprehensive theory of the world then Newtonian physics all of the

125
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,259
electronics you used wouldn't work if quantum physics wasn't correct roughly

126
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,100
speaking and so that little tiny anomaly blew into something that knocked the

127
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,850
slats out underneath from underneath the entire axiomatic structure of Newtonian

128
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,180
physics it showed it was wrong at its fundamental levels

129
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,029
even though it turned out to be a subset a correct subset of something that was

130
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,809
much broader and so you can kind of think of that as that's what kids are

131
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,849
doing as they progress they develop a theory that accounts for a certain set

132
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,879
of you could say fact but this is another place it gets tricky and then

133
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,709
they modify those and make them more and more refined but now and then they have

134
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:29,549
to under grow quite a transformation not be a stage transition in Piaget and

135
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,179
thought that that's the stage transition idea and that would be akin in some

136
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,479
sense to a kuhnian scientific revolution now what Piaget is trying to state here

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,300
is that because you there's this weird problem with facts which is that they

138
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,769
tend to transform across time you know like if you go take a biology course

139
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,568
right now in 20 years pretty much everything you read you learned or very

140
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:53,750
much of what you learned will turn out to have been wrong and that's kind of

141
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,789
weird because it isn't wrong right now and you think well how can it be wrong

142
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:01,269
in 20 years and that that's a really complicated problem and in order to

143
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,999
solve that you kind of have to think about facts like tools instead of them

144
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:10,500
as thinking about them as objective independent realities because a bad tool

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,409
can still work as a tool whereas a bad fact just kills you stone dead and so

146
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:22,028
there's any ways in any case that seems to be a completely unnecessary phenomena

147
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:57,749
Oh God there's no reason for that that's just

148
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:05,180
sheer spite as far as I can tell mm-hmm okay so so here's one of psays

149
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:12,649
propositions and and it is that because facts flux in some sense across time

150
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,009
you're looking for something that doesn't change across time to call it a

151
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:18,600
real fact and so what Piaget is trying to point out in this let's call it

152
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,749
introductory paragraph is that the one thing that doesn't change is the manner

153
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:25,189
in which people generate facts rather than the facts themselves so the

154
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:29,860
ultimate fact is a fact about the way people generate facts all right and so

155
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,089
psays theory in part is a is a theory about how knowledge is acquired and

156
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,560
transformed and so it's not that no it's not a study of the knowledge itself it's

157
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,768
a study of the process by which the knowledge is generated and he believed

158
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,379
that that process was unchanging at least with regards to human beings and

159
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:51,188
so you could think of the Piaget alien genetic epistemological mystery as being

160
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:55,438
how is it that people form and transform representations of the world and one of

161
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:58,698
his conclusions about that is that there's a standard process and then the

162
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:02,258
reason that I'm telling you about Piaget right now is because as far as I can

163
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,600
tell the standard Piaget daeun description of the manner in which

164
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,720
knowledge is acquired and transformed is the same thing that's represented in the

165
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,778
mythology of the shamanic transformation which is that there's a state of being

166
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:17,100
and then it's derp up disrupted by something chaotic and there's a

167
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,449
disintegration period and that's the space between the stage transitions for

168
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,990
for children in which time they're often upset because their little theory about

169
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,678
the world isn't learning it isn't working anymore

170
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:32,088
and then in that chaotic period they adjust themselves to new anomalies and

171
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,499
anomalies or what occur when you act in the world and what you want to happen

172
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:38,899
doesn't happen right because that means there's something wrong with your

173
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,970
knowledge structure if you act and then something happens you don't want to

174
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,050
happen something's wrong with the way you're representing the world or you

175
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,278
could say something's wrong with the world but good luck with that although

176
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,629
you know people can modify the world as well as modifying their belief

177
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:58,639
structures and people do that a lot but so this the piagetian stage transition

178
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,629
as far as I can tell is a micro case of the broader idea of the the existence

179
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,000
an orderly state its dissolution into a chaotic state because something

180
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,839
unexpected has occurred and then it's retransfer Meishan into a more

181
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,619
integrated state now Piaget would say well the initial state and the chaotic

182
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:19,050
state and the final state aren't the ultimate realities the ultimate reality

183
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,568
is the process of moving through those stages and that's how people acquire

184
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,818
knowledge and that's you could say that's the central element of human

185
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:30,799
beings and I would say that's a that's another reason Tatian of the hero myth

186
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,028
because the hero is the person who notes uh normally notes something that's

187
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:40,808
changed that's outside of explored territory encounters it defeats it let's

188
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:45,509
say or get something of value from it and then recasts it into the world

189
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,759
shares it with the community restructures of the world and so that's

190
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,399
the central story it's it's not the central story of human beings but it's

191
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,169
it's close enough for for our purposes at the moment so okay so that's what

192
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,919
Piaget is about how do human beings encounter

193
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,778
the world and and what happens when they do that now the thing about the world

194
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:09,568
for Piaget is it's also a complicated place it's not exactly the set of it's

195
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:13,639
not the set of all objective facts that remain to be discovered because Piaget

196
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,480
is a constructivist and he's more of a pragmatist than he is precisely a

197
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
scientific realist and so that's a complicated thing very very complicated

198
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,799
thing I don't know if any of you and maybe this is completely irrelevant I

199
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,049
don't know if any of you listened to my argument with Sam Harris but Sam Harris

200
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,208
is a scientific realist and I was trying to make at least in part at Piaget Ian's

201
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:39,618
point but he was having none of that that's for sure but but Piaget makes the

202
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,470
point and so you know I'm going to let him speak in some sense as we proceed

203
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:49,249
through this and and well you'll see why he does what he does so if all knowledge

204
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:52,749
is always in the state of development and consists in proceeding from one

205
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:59,209
state to a more complete and efficient one so that that implies a hierarchy of

206
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,219
states right that you move from one knowledge structure to the next one

207
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,239
which includes the previous one and is better and it's better because it covers

208
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,860
more territory that's how you know it's better it does the same thing the old

209
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,409
tool does plus some additional things so it's a definition of better it's a good

210
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,019
thing to have a definition of better and worse

211
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,190
all knowledge is always in the state of development and consists in proceeding

212
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,160
for one state to a more complete deficient one evidently it is a question

213
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,178
of knowing this development and analyzing it with the greatest possible

214
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:31,088
accuracy which is something I happen to agree with but that's partly because I

215
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,249
read Piaget and and I think I understand what he meant and he's quite the thinker

216
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:39,989
and so I'm gonna see if I can like clue you in a little bit about this because

217
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:43,110
it's it's well it's exceedingly complex you know and most of the time when

218
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,428
people talk about Piaget they just talk about his surface experiments they don't

219
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:50,730
talk about what he was actually up to and what he was up to was well he was

220
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,259
trying to figure out how people represent the world and learned and

221
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,230
that's not only it's not only that you know this is another thing people don't

222
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,579
know about Piaget is that he was trying to reconcile the chasm between science

223
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,149
and values that's what drove him through his entire intellectual life he was

224
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:09,089
attempting to bridge the gap between science and religion that's another way

225
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,149
of thinking about it and and that was explicit he knew that that's why he did

226
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,318
everything he did and so the thing that's so cool about Piaget I think is

227
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,868
that he actually started to provide what you might think about as a rational

228
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:25,939
basis for morality it's not exactly rational that's the thing because it's

229
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:29,448
rational rational belief like scientific realism has a certain set of

230
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:34,078
presuppositions at its core and Piaget doesn't use those presuppositions to

231
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,188
solve the problem get a problem so deep the gap between what is and what ought

232
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:44,078
to be that's the David Humes problem you can't derive a naught from it is just

233
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,948
because you know a bunch of things doesn't give you an unerring guide to

234
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:51,958
know what to do about those things there's a gap there and Harris and

235
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,688
people like him say that gap is illusory but most philosophers including David

236
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:01,149
Hume including Piaget these are heavy-duty people including Heidegger

237
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,019
would would disagree with that they don't believe that that that that gap is

238
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:09,709
non-existent and and and Harris believes that you can nest values within science

239
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,549
and and that's the proposition that he continually puts forward like most of

240
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:17,169
the so-called new atheists but it's a hell of a lot more difficult to do than

241
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,970
you think that's for sure and so anyway so how is Piaget purporting to manage

242
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,350
this well one thing he does is he for Piaget it's really important that you

243
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,939
have a body and that's one of the things that's four

244
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,470
cool about his thinking so you could think about him as an early exponent of

245
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,069
embodied cognition it's like he's not exactly a Cartesian a follower of

246
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:42,929
Descartes he doesn't really believe that you have a spirit or say a rational mind

247
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,080
that is in some sense separate from your body which is an implicit presupposition

248
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:52,399
of a lot of a lot of of philosophical claims Piaget really sticks you in your

249
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,259
body and the other thing that Piaget claims is that your abstract knowledge

250
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:00,720
is actually determined by the structure of your body and that it unfolds from

251
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,569
your body up into abstraction and that's what happens as infants transform into

252
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,099
adults first of all almost all their knowledge is embodied and what that

253
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,309
means is that it's not look there's a couple of different kinds of memory like

254
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,569
the most the most fundamental distinction you might think of is

255
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:21,859
between procedural representation procedural memory and and

256
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,189
representational memory so when you remember your past that little movie or

257
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,279
that runs in your head or maybe the facts that you can recite about your

258
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,430
past that's episodic memory that's

259
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,390
representational but procedural memory is different procedural memories how you

260
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,870
walk you don't know how you walk that's how you ride a bike it's how you play

261
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:42,709
the piano it's how you type so it's it's automatic right it's built into your

262
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,870
nervous system it's built into the nerves that innervate your musculature

263
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:51,049
and there's completely separate memory systems now one can represent the other

264
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,210
which is interesting the representational system can represent

265
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,680
the output of the body which is basically what you happen what happens

266
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,990
when someone tells a story even when you tell a story about your own life but the

267
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:07,710
contents of procedural memory precede the contents of representational memory

268
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,690
and they're shaped in different ways so for example part of the wisdom that's

269
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,380
encoded in your body is there because of things you've practiced but it's also

270
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,130
there because you've practiced things in a social environment and so while you

271
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,981
practice those things the effect of the social environment shaped the way you

272
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,349
learned it and that's encoded right in your neurons

273
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:30,259
it's not representational it's encoded in the way you do things it's encoded in

274
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:34,500
the way you smile when you look at someone or frown or when you do that and

275
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,990
that's all implicit it's not under your conscious control it's not even in that

276
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,870
system and so Piaget figured this out and so one of the things he said was

277
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,939
that you start as an infant by building your

278
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,200
cedral memory not your representational memory that's partly perhaps why you

279
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,180
can't remember your infancy you know I actually don't have that kind of

280
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,820
representational memory there what you do is you act you learn to act you build

281
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:00,849
your body so that it can move and you do that partly by experimenting with your

282
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:04,480
own body but you also do that by experimenting with your body in a

283
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,829
context that's shaped from the beginning by the presence of other people so for

284
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:12,470
example you know what child learns how to breastfeed its mouth is pretty wired

285
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,600
up right at birth hey and and the rest of its body isn't wired up very much at

286
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,179
all but its mouth is and you might think well that's just a reflex and that

287
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,110
Piaget would agree with that it's a built in it's something built in that

288
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:27,909
that a baby can do right at birth but even in the act of breastfeeding the

289
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,170
baby has to learn how to modify that reflex so that it gets along with its

290
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,060
mother so even at the very beginning with the most you might think the most

291
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:42,079
primordial acts there's a sociological and influence and there's a mutual

292
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,679
dynamic going on that's really really important it's really important and so

293
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,000
in some sense for Piaget the structure of society is implicitly built into the

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,900
structure of the procedural memory system and so one of the things you

295
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,630
might think about that and Piaget makes much of this because he looks at the

296
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,630
relationship between play and dreams and imitation so he's kind of a quasi

297
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:10,910
psychoanalyst one of the things that means is that coded in your behavior

298
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:18,300
coded in your behavior is is this is the social structure in which you emerged

299
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,649
and it's coded in a way that you don't actually understand you just know how to

300
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,920
act and then you can figure out how you're acting and you can extract out of

301
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,740
that some of the social rules but you don't you don't that doesn't mean that

302
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,349
you know the rules it meant that the rules were built into you here's the way

303
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:37,349
of thinking about it like a wolf pack wolf pack knows how to operate together

304
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:40,849
it knows how to hunt right and each wolf knows where every other wolf is in the

305
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,909
dominance hierarchy but they don't know they know that they don't have rules

306
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,920
right they don't have a code they don't have laws what they have is behavioral

307
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,821
regularities patterned behavioral regularities and those are like a

308
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,569
morality they're very very in fact that's exactly what they are a dominance

309
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,960
hierarchy of animal that aren't representational you know

310
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,259
that don't have language at least they don't have language the dominance

311
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:08,460
hierarchy is a kind of morality it's a way of it's a way of setting up

312
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,190
individual behavior within a social context to maximize cooperation and

313
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,620
minimize competition and so well so Piaget would say that you know the

314
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,229
origin of more and and Fran's de Waal who's a great primatologist by the way

315
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,839
Fran's fr ansd de w AAL he's written a lot of books about the emergence of

316
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,369
morality and chimpanzees in particular and you know he follows the same line of

317
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:33,859
logic it's that the morality emerges out of the interaction between the

318
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,529
chimpanzees and it's bounded by the necessity that the actions take certain

319
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,519
forms so for example if the chimpanzees act in a way that each of them kills

320
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,930
everyone else it's like that's the end of it

321
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,750
it's the end of the game so that's not a very functional morality it's it doesn't

322
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,730
produce survival of the individuals it doesn't produce flourishing of the

323
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,900
individuals certainly it produces extinction of the individuals and the

324
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,019
death of the group so as far as do all would concerned from an evolutionary

325
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,900
perspective that sort of mode of interacting is a dead end and so one of

326
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,290
Pia Jays claims implicit claims is that and this is one of the things that's so

327
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:17,710
brilliant about Piaget is that the interactions between people the social

328
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:23,140
interactions between people necessarily emerge within a kind of bounded space

329
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,690
and the space is the space of the game so we're always playing games always and

330
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,269
a game you might think about a game as a microcosm of the world and a small

331
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:38,069
child's game is a tiny fractional microcosm of the world but then you get

332
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:42,109
up into adult games and you could think about those maybe as multiplayer online

333
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,599
games that's one good representation but even more sophisticated things like

334
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,699
being a lawyer say are like working at McDonald's or any of those things those

335
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,230
are also forms of game and and that P and people negotiate the rules and that

336
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,950
game is nested inside sets of broader games and so for Piaget that the game

337
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,259
that killed the games the children play kind of transform inexorably and and and

338
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,740
what incrementally into the games that adults play and and a

339
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,700
a game that's playable as an adult is a functional game it's it's an acceptable

340
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,830
game and one of PJ's claims is that not only do people start playing games

341
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:26,369
unconsciously in a sense and implicitly then they start to play games more

342
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,889
consciously they actually they actually represent the games to some degree at

343
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,759
least in their actions then they start to learn the explicit rules of the game

344
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,329
but only later after they know how to play it and then at the highest stage of

345
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:42,779
moral development they start to realize that not only are they players of games

346
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,250
and followers of a rules but they're also producers of rules so it starts you

347
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,299
start out not being able to play a game at all then you can play a game with

348
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,899
yourself then you can play a game with a few other people then you can play

349
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,940
rule-governed games with lots of people and then you realize that you make the

350
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,370
rules and you can make new games and that's the highest level of moral

351
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,199
development according to Piaget it's varrick's brilliant it's it's bloody

352
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,360
brilliant he's the first person that I ever really encountered who was able to

353
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:15,539
put the notion of an emergent morality on something you know broadly

354
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,589
commensurate with a scientific perspective but you have to understand

355
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:22,279
that in order to do that he had to sacrifice a little bit of his notions of

356
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,490
scientific realism and that's what makes him a constructivist and so and so we're

357
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,819
going back to constructivism so he says at the beginning and this is the

358
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,519
beginning of the development of knowledge does not unfold itself as a

359
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,000
matter of chance but forms a development so he said there's not only do knowledge

360
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,400
structures change across time and they're embedded in the social world but

361
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,730
the manner in which they change across time actually has a bit of a structure

362
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,349
and so that would be the Piaget lien stages of development just so you know

363
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:53,969
now people have debated ever since Piaget proposed this if those

364
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,220
developmental stages are fixed and necessary and if he identified them

365
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,329
properly and even and as well whether or not they could be sped up which he

366
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:06,689
always called the American problem could you speed up these stages of development

367
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,360
and there's a lot of argument about whether those stages exist in the manner

368
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,979
that Piaget described there and whether they're fixed at all of that but that's

369
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,960
still the fundamental elements of his the fundamental element of his theory so

370
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,049
and in since the cognitive domain has an absolute beginning which means you were

371
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,269
you're here now but at one point you weren't so there was an absolute

372
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:32,819
beginning to to you as a phenomena it's to be studied at the very stages nor

373
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:36,250
known as formation that's his rationalization for being a genetic

374
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,349
epistemology right someone who studies the formation of knowledge structures

375
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,119
across time like an embryologist someone like that right who developmental

376
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,029
embryologist the first aim of genetic epistemology is therefore if one can say

377
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:51,509
so to take psychology seriously and to furnish verifications to any question

378
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,339
which each epistemology necessarily raises yet replacing the generally

379
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,480
unsatisfying speculative or implicit psychology with controllable analysis

380
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,990
and so basically what he's saying there is that you can guess in a sense like

381
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,950
Freud did about developmental psychology Freud kind of projected backwards from

382
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,259
his patients into the dim mists of childhood and came up with like a what

383
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:15,809
would a hypothetical developmental sequence and Piaget said well we're not

384
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,710
going to do that we're going to go run experiments on kids often individuals

385
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,880
but sometimes multiple individuals we're gonna we're going to observe exactly

386
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,610
what they're doing he watched his kids in their cribs for example unbelievably

387
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:32,539
intently and with great he was like an ethologist which is a person who studies

388
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,450
animal behavior observational II like Fran's de Waal he was like an ethologist

389
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,539
of children not exactly an experimental psychologist although also an

390
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,809
experimental psychologist and he more or less established the field of

391
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,509
developmental psychology so he said well let's empirically analyze how children

392
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,299
learn and then maybe we can figure out how this knowledge process unfolds and

393
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:56,700
we don't have to guess about it we can we can use controllable analysis and so

394
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,620
you could say he introduced scientific methodology even though he wasn't a

395
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:03,559
scientific realist he introduced scientific methodology into the study of

396
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,859
child development but more importantly into the study of how knowledge

397
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:11,039
structures unfold across time so he was a philosopher as well but a strange type

398
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,649
of philosopher because he was interested in how philosophy itself emerges in the

399
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,620
mind of the child and so that's what Piaget was up to and so quite quite

400
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:23,779
remarkable and he had incredibly wide range of interests befitting someone who

401
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:29,349
probably had an IQ of like 190 I mean he was seriously smart guy like way way

402
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:32,789
outside of the normal range and so this is the sort of questions he was trying

403
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,980
to answer well how do you on what do you base your judgments cuz you make

404
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,059
judgments about things better or worse well how how do you come up with that

405
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:47,779
ability how does that emerge and on what basis do you make the judgments

406
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,090
there's a famous ruling on pornography that I believe the Supreme Court of the

407
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,459
United States laid down and one of the justices wrote something that's become

408
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,759
infamous or famous depending on how you look at he said well I can't define

409
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,049
pornography but I know it when I see it and and that's and that's a notion of

410
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,569
the incomplete ability of the representational system to represent the

411
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:13,259
contents of implicit perception or the procedural system you can know that you

412
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,829
know something but you that doesn't mean you can describe why it doesn't mean you

413
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:20,899
can describe how you know it and you don't how do you focus your eyes like

414
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,580
you don't know how you focus your eyes you just focus them you know how do you

415
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:31,210
smile like this well maybe less ugly but you know you you can't describe how you

416
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,670
do it you can't describe the musculature you can represent the output of the act

417
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,120
and you can do it but you can't represent it and you're just stuffed

418
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,919
full of skills like that which is another example of the way that you're

419
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,060
way more complicated than your understanding of you you know one of the

420
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,450
things people often ask is how can we use the rat as a model of a person

421
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,029
because like you know a rats not much of a person depending of course on the

422
00:29:54,029 --> 00:30:00,170
person but the the real answer to that is well compared to what like compared

423
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,460
to your understanding of a person a rat is an excellent model of a person so

424
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,059
it's not as good a model of a person as a person is but compared to imagination

425
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:15,240
let's say it's incomparably better and you know that's because we share like I

426
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,059
don't know what 98% of our genes or some damn thing with rats it's like it's

427
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:24,919
really up I think we share 90% of our genes with yeast for God's sake you know

428
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,480
and so we're a lot more rat-like than yeast like so and I think with chimps

429
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,160
it's over 99% you know so it's not a bad model obviously it's not perfect but it

430
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,800
always depends on what you compare it to you know and you hear animal rights

431
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,460
activists say things like well we can replace that with computer simulations

432
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,100
it's like no we can't because you can't simulate what you don't know or at least

433
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:50,529
not very well so that's a silly idea you know even though they have a point it's

434
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,990
not so great to torture animals to death and all

435
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,279
but what are his norms well that's a good question where do norms for

436
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,240
behavior come from you have norms when they're violated it annoys you doesn't

437
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,480
mean you know what your norms are but you do kind of get a sense of what they

438
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,220
are when they get violated that really upset me well what does that mean

439
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,240
well you don't really know you might have to think about that for like six

440
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,630
months why you got so upset about that but you can notice that you got upset

441
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,290
and that means that you do have expectations and norms let's say but you

442
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,859
don't know where they came from now obviously in part they came from your

443
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,679
intrinsic structure but also a core they're a consequence of your learning

444
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,029
but even more importantly they're our consequence of your learning in a social

445
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:34,539
environment so all of those phenomena which exceed your comprehension

446
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,289
determine the nature of your norms and often you only detect them when they're

447
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:42,619
violated so because why bother paying attention to something that works

448
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:47,359
you just don't know one does they take it for granted it's almost the

449
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,529
definition of something working it's like you know you think I'm driving my

450
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,500
car to school and you think you're in a car but you're really not in a car

451
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
you're in a thing that gets you from home to school and you can pretend that

452
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:20,799
that is so annoying you can pretend that

453
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,129
so you might think well the thing that I'm I'm in is it's kind of a weird

454
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,380
example is it is this object with objective qualities that you call a car

455
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,850
but but that isn't exactly how you actually perceive or act towards it what

456
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:37,219
happens is is that as long as it's doing what it's supposed to do which means

457
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,079
that its function is intact not what it is but its function then you can use a

458
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,730
really low resolution representation of the thing the car is just what gets you

459
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,870
from point A to point B right and so the fact that you don't understand the damn

460
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:54,219
thing at all is completely invisible to you but it isn't when it quits as soon

461
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,500
as it quits it becomes a car it's like bang car oh my god I don't understand

462
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,730
this thing at all now what do I do well you panic a little bit right

463
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,539
because well what do you know about your car nothing nothing nothing at all and

464
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:12,019
worse than that now the car has become an intersection between you and

465
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,460
whoever's going to fix your card so that introduces a whole bunch of human

466
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,500
elements into it like are they going to figure out what's wrong with it are they

467
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,720
going to rip you off is your car ever going to work again are you going to get

468
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,400
to work what's going to happen tonight so all of a sudden that thing that you

469
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,019
were in that was a car turns into this massive complex unbelievably complicated

470
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:35,190
thing and that's actually what it is your initial representation of it it's

471
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,240
like it's really low resolution it's like one bit and then bang it breaks

472
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,599
down and poof complexity complexity complexity everywhere and that

473
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,730
complexity that's what the world's made out if you remember we talked about

474
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,809
William James and that crazy nitrous oxide induced pseudo hippie poetry that

475
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,299
he was writing in the 1890s when he was talking about chaos

476
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:02,779
well that chaos that he was talking about out of which him order emerges

477
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,250
that's the same thing as that complexity that's hovering in the background and

478
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,659
children have to operate in a world that's actually that complex but they're

479
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,679
not smart enough and neither are you so they build partial representations that

480
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,608
sort of work and the parents scaffold them so the way children manage that's

481
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:21,639
like children they don't know anything but stay they're still alive so what's

482
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,700
up with that you know part of it is the child is laying out

483
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:29,509
one of its procedures in the world in accordance with its understanding and

484
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,909
something goes wrong what does the child do cry

485
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,320
right it defaults it defaults to this distress cry and what happens is the

486
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,090
adults move in with their superior skills and their enhanced understanding

487
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,879
and they mediate between the partial knowledge of the child in the actual

488
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,710
complex world and without the child that's why if you take your child to the

489
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,829
mall and just leave you know it doesn't take very long for them to get really

490
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:59,630
really really really upset you know depending on the child some of them

491
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,110
almost instantaneously you know one day I was in the Boston Airport with my

492
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,829
daughter she was about three and three and a half maybe and my son he was about

493
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,019
two and we were there to pick someone I was just packed and so I had them by the

494
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,969
hand you know and I were told my daughter a bunch if she ever got

495
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:20,000
separated from me in a crowd just to sit down immediately wherever she was or as

496
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,489
close there by it I would find her don't move well somehow I got separated from

497
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:30,659
them and I looked behind them and they weren't there and I found out later she

498
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:35,429
followed someone else who looked like me from behind and she I found her in about

499
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:38,649
three minutes you know which is a long time man if you're three years old at

500
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,380
that Airport she was sitting there like paralyzed you know but her brother was

501
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,920
with her he didn't care at all and the reason he didn't care is because as far

502
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,369
as he was concerned she was an adult but as far as she was concerned she was an

503
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:56,190
abandoned kid in an airport you know it was very hard on her and it's because

504
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,650
the you know she was protected from the complexity by her primordial

505
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,960
representations and my presence but as soon as my presence disappeared the

506
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,289
complexity came flooding back and just overwhelmed her that's chaos and

507
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:12,550
uncertainty and then she'd cry and the cry says help I'm out of my league I'm

508
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,080
drowning I'm drowning you know intervened and so that's how kids in

509
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,569
part can get along in the world with their incomplete knowledge

510
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,010
representations always huh also how you get along in the world because you're

511
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,920
incomplete beyond belief but you got all these other people around you in the

512
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,099
whole damn society filling in the gaps and so you walk around like you know

513
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,819
what you're doing but you don't you know you just hardly know at all you know if

514
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,220
you can fit into that system great you've got it on your side and you can

515
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:43,819
use it to fill the gaps that's also partly why people are so concerned with

516
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,050
maintaining their social identity like the real identity on

517
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,000
talking about some surface identity but you see because you have set up a set of

518
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,909
expectations and desires about how you want the world to unfold and you do that

519
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:03,539
within a social context and as long as your desires and the actions of the

520
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,860
community match which means you're at home roughly speaking as long as they

521
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,190
match you stay emotionally regulated you like that that's why you can stay calm

522
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,360
in here it's like your desires are being played out by everyone else because one

523
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,900
of your desires is that none of these crazy primate starts brandishing a knife

524
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,019
for example or even twitching or any of that sort of thing you don't want any of

525
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:30,699
that and if it starts happening it's like you get weary very quickly and

526
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:33,949
maybe you look and maybe you won't and maybe you'll freeze maybe you'll get the

527
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:37,159
hell out of there or maybe you'll get aggressive but that match has to

528
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,879
maintain itself intact or your entire nervous system gets dysregulated and the

529
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,570
reason for that is that as soon as that match is disrupted the underlying

530
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,690
complexity and chaos of the world reveals itself and so does your

531
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,730
inadequacy and then your body defaults into predator mode and and the fact that

532
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,659
you don't know anything and that everything is really complicated becomes

533
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:03,069
very evident to you very quickly and people hate that it's the worst thing

534
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,190
that can happen to them the bottom falling out of their world and so that

535
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,980
happens more when your fundamental presumptions about things are are

536
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,039
challenged and then you have to solve the problem of what constitutes a

537
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,789
fundamental presupposition you know how do you know which presupposition is

538
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:22,429
peripheral in which one central and you can tell in part because the more upset

539
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:27,299
you get about something the more central it is that that things about to your

540
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,960
entire structure of belief and that's one way of getting into that unconscious

541
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,809
structure of belief from a psychoanalytic perspective so what are

542
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,820
the things that happens to me for example as a therapist is I'll be

543
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,570
talking to my clients and they'll be talking about something difficult and

544
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,200
all of a sudden they'll cry and they often don't know why so I stopped them

545
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,909
right there it's like something went through your mind something happened and

546
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,319
the cry indicates that you've moved beyond your domain of competence out

547
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,570
into the unknown world all of a sudden into chaos what's that chaos what

548
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,539
exactly happened and people you know they're usually embarrassed that they

549
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:02,619
cry but often make remember what flitted through their mind

550
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:06,769
and it's a represent it's a it's some encounter with the chaos beyond their

551
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:10,500
conceptual systems that produces that emotional response and then we can dig

552
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,840
into that find out oh that's a trauma especially if it's more than a year -

553
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,570
how fold and those can be of various depths and profundity you know sometimes

554
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,059
they're so bad that the person just breaks down completely and they never

555
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,070
put themselves together you know that's when something's just walloped you it's

556
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,350
hit you right at the bottom of your axiomatic structures so to speak right

557
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:32,909
at the trunk but when you're doing therapy with people and you watch how

558
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:36,819
they respond emotionally you look for those tiny eruptions of negative emotion

559
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,190
and those are like holes in their conceptual structure and those have to

560
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,220
be sewed up by their man you in the process of dialogue you figure out okay

561
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,079
there was a bit of unexplored territory there that manifested itself it produced

562
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,309
an emotional response in you that indicates that you've reverted in some

563
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,360
sense to childhood that would be the Freudian interpretation now we have to

564
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,860
figure out what it was that that's in that hole what caused that tear and then

565
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,650
we have to go back and articulate it and analyze and study it until we can sew it

566
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,510
up and then and art and and get to the gist of it to make it into a adaptive

567
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,550
story and then you can leave it behind and it actually produces neurological

568
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,720
transformation as you do that the memories in some sense actually move

569
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:23,219
their psychophysiological location you could say their location in your psyche

570
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,219
but you can also note that the brain systems that are handling the memories

571
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:30,639
aren't the same so they're much more limbic they're way

572
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,529
lower and closer to the emotional centers when it's still raw trauma and

573
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,670
by the time it's fully articulated it's more represented in an articulated story

574
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,079
a causal story and that's partly why writing about emotional events actually

575
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,949
helps you overcome them so and it's possible that writing about how it is

576
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:51,899
that you overcome emotional events in general is actually the best kind of

577
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,320
therapy right not how do you solve a particular problem but how is it that

578
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,170
you orient yourself in the world so that you solve the class of the fact that

579
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,079
there are problems right that's that's the ultimate story and I think that's

580
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,929
the hero myth and I also think that that's the knowledge generating process

581
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:12,199
that Piaget is talking about you that's because you have you're constantly

582
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,460
overcoming problems in the world and the problems are that you don't know

583
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,130
enough to get what you want from the world and so you get that mismatch

584
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,269
mismatch there's you've got whole brain systems

585
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:25,230
that are designed to do nothing but detect that mismatch like crucial

586
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,190
central brain structures and we'll talk about that a lot when we get into the

587
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,539
into the physiology so all right how does on what does an individual basis

588
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:38,289
judgments water is norms how are they validated how do you know if you're

589
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:41,989
right about your norms what's the interest of such norms for the

590
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:45,959
philosophy of science in general that's a really tough one it's like well you

591
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,970
have norms and expectations as a human being and because of that they they have

592
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:56,529
a determining influence on the manner in which you conduct science so for example

593
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,810
here's one of the problems with a straight realist view so we could be

594
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,769
having a discussion and I could say well you know that tile is to the right of

595
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:08,159
that tile and then I could say well this brick is smaller than that brick and

596
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,869
then I could say you know the roof is white really quite white there and start

597
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,549
back there and like after about 20 statements like that you're just going

598
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,570
to want to slap me and the reason for that is that well those statements are

599
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,210
perfectly valid representations of fact but there's an infinite number of facts

600
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:29,619
and most of them are irrelevant and that's the thing that's the thing the

601
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:33,589
facts have to be relevant like if you come to a lecture and all the person

602
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,289
does is tell you irrelevant facts what happens you've been in lots of lectures

603
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:41,320
like that what happens when you start fantasizing about something that might

604
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:49,710
be more worthwhile you know or you go to sleep because your

605
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,070
brain is a lot smarter than you are it figures hell if all we're gonna get

606
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,170
exposed to here is an infinite infinite number of irrelevant facts we might as

607
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,010
well have a nap until something important happens so it's true it's

608
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,420
exactly how it works now this is gonna get big isn't that what happens next

609
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:11,480
No so okay so and then how does the fact that the child children think

610
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,929
differently affect our presumption of fact itself children live in the world

611
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:20,849
they think differently about the world but yet they survive and so well I

612
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,630
already mentioned a partial solution to that adults intercede you know around

613
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,070
the edges around the borders children do this all the time a so it's called

614
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,789
referencing and they do it two ways so for example if you're in a room with

615
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:37,769
your child maybe to wait and mouse runs across the child will orient to it watch

616
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:41,710
it track it that's pretty much unconscious and the mother let's say

617
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,809
will do that too and then the child looks at the mouse and then looks at the

618
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:49,309
mother and the reason is is because the child doesn't know what the mouse is and

619
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:52,630
so then it looks at the mother to read from the mothers face which is a

620
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,470
projection screen of emotions how to classify the mouse in terms of import

621
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:00,358
and if the mother is like all calm about it and gives the kid a pad it's like you

622
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,949
know okay whatever you know not a danger that's what the

623
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:11,429
mouse is first danger not danger it's way after that that it's a mouse

624
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:14,779
you think no it's a mouse to begin with it's like these things are not so

625
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,490
straightforward they are not so straightforward so anyways if the mother

626
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,899
climbs up on the table it has a screaming fit then the child's already

627
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,630
prepared because of this anomaly to be emotionally responsive the child looks

628
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,960
at the mothers face it's got terror on at the mouse child takes small danger

629
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,920
big danger it's like phobia phobia phobia now all kids that won't happen to

630
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,460
you because some are very emotionally robust but if they're very Charles very

631
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,369
high in neuroticism trait neuroticism the probability that they'll develop a

632
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:49,410
permanent semi-permanent fear of the mouse is extraordinarily high and that's

633
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:53,250
what should happen because the mother tells you what the mouse is and in the

634
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,409
face does it's a mouse it says safety danger and that's the first thing you

635
00:44:58,409 --> 00:44:59,980
want to know about something is it safer is it

636
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,920
dangerous and that's a tricky one eh because whether something is safe for

637
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,889
dangerous is not exactly an objective fact there's a guy named JJ Gibson who

638
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:12,259
wrote a book called NACA logical approach to visual perception which I

639
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,130
would highly recommend and his claim in that book it's a real work of genius I

640
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,950
believe is that when you see when you walk towards a cliff you don't see a

641
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:25,529
cliff you don't see a cliff and infer danger what you see is a falling off

642
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,960
place and you infer cliff and you can tell that some of you have vertigo you

643
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,550
go up on the 26th floor out into balcony and it's like you don't want to go near

644
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,539
the edge maybe you feel like you're gonna throw yourself over because people

645
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,239
have that kind of what if what if I fell or what if I jumped over it's like stay

646
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:45,419
away from that it's like that perception of the danger precedes your perception

647
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,159
of the balcony and the object now you know that's how your brain is wired the

648
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,608
dangers first object second so in people with blind sight who I've talked about

649
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:58,529
before who think they're blind they can't see then they tell you that they

650
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,980
could still detect fearful faces and you could detect their detection by

651
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,440
measuring their skin conductance and so their eyes are mapping right on to their

652
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,889
fear and reflex systems without any intermediary of objective perception

653
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:12,940
whatsoever so don't be thinking that what you see in the world is the

654
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,159
objective world and then infer its meaning it could easily be exactly

655
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,819
backwards and it looks like if you look at how the brain is set up that it is in

656
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,789
fact actually backwards or at least parallel but but the but the danger not

657
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:30,210
danger perception has to be very very very very fast and so it precedes the

658
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,730
more elaborate cognitive interpretations even the perceptions because it actually

659
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,800
takes a while to see something because it's really complicated to see something

660
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,670
and so you can't just wait around to see the damn thing before you act you just

661
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,780
not fast enough so they say if you're a pro tennis player the time it takes the

662
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,490
ball to leave your opponent's racket to get to you is not long enough for you to

663
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:56,459
plan any motor act so what you're doing is you've got them what you dis inhibit

664
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,070
the motor act by looking at the stance of your opponent and watching and by the

665
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,980
time they hit it you're already prepared for the response because you just not

666
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,000
it's coming at 120 miles an hour it's like it's going fifty feet you don't

667
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,849
have the reflexes for it so your your your eyes are making

668
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:17,779
body ready without in some sense without your conscious perception you become

669
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,710
conscious if you make a mistake right in fact that's kind of what consciousness

670
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,150
is for it's like detect error fix detect error fix

671
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,940
that's consciousness it's not plan what you're going to do next although it's

672
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,480
not that simple either other problems that Piaget was trying to address well

673
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,030
what water numbers what does it mean for there to be space what what do we mean

674
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,820
when we when we talk about time how do we how did we come up with that concept

675
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:48,260
what does speed mean how do we know an object is permanent how do we know that

676
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,910
an object stays the same across sets of transformation so that's a very classic

677
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:56,469
piagetian problem so let's say you give a kid a bowl of clay and then you crush

678
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:00,669
it so it's now a cylinder is like is that the same thing or is it a different

679
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,340
thing and the answer is well it's the same thing and it's a different thing

680
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,390
but there's something about it that remained constant across the

681
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:12,219
transformations and so one of the things that Piaget is trying to figure out is

682
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:16,179
what remains constant across transformations because you might think

683
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:20,219
about that is a real fact protons are like that right they remain constant

684
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,899
across transformations and so we assume that they're pretty damn real and they

685
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,720
last I don't know how long protons last it's like I don't know what it is it's

686
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,189
some tens of billions of so don't worry your protons are going to just sit right

687
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,190
there and behave you know so they last for a very very very long time across

688
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,460
sets of transformation so we can regard them as real he was interested in why

689
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,050
children play and why there are patterns in play and how that's related to dreams

690
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,490
and he was really interested in the fact that we imitate other people and this is

691
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,309
another part of Piaget staggering genius in my estimation because he was one of

692
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:56,460
the early developmental thinkers who understood that our capacity for

693
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,630
learning was not so much mediated by language as it was mediated by our

694
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:05,680
capacity to use our bodies to represent the bodies of other people and that's

695
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,299
mind-boggling it's a mind-boggling idea so you know you hear monkey-see

696
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,570
monkey-do but it's actually not true they're not very good at imitating

697
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:20,059
octopuses or octopi they can imitate actually so if you give a octopus a

698
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:23,460
bottle with a cork in it and there's a crab in the cork it can figure out how

699
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,490
to get out the cork and sneak out the crab but if you get an octopus to watch

700
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:29,349
it our octopus do that it'll learn to do it

701
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:33,289
faster those things are smart and that's partly that's because they're all

702
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,820
tentacley right and so they actually have something they can do something

703
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,119
with like our hands there's our tentacles you know an octopus I can

704
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,019
operate in the world because they have tentacles and and you know you hear

705
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,199
about the superhuman intelligence of things like dolphins and whales it's

706
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,779
like ya know they're basically test tubes you know what what are we gonna do

707
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,680
now tap a city it's like no they're not gonna do that

708
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,929
they can't manipulate the world so whatever their intelligence is it's way

709
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:04,149
different than ours okay imitation so partly what you're doing all the time is

710
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,950
imitating other people all of you are imitating each other right now

711
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:13,169
you can tell because look around you're all doing exactly the same thing so it's

712
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,450
it's mass imitation and that's really a huge part of social structure is that

713
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:21,519
we're constantly imitating each other and so that means that your body and her

714
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,880
body are very much matched physiologically right now you're in the

715
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,829
same state and you can tell because you basically have the same expression and

716
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:33,069
as long as all you crazy primates violent primates have the same

717
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:38,170
expression on you can pretty much be sure that all of you are thinking and

718
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,230
about to do approximately the same thing and so you can keep that match between

719
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:47,010
your desire slash expectation and reality happening and that's why we have

720
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,600
a face it's so that other people know what the hell we're up to and that's why

721
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:53,819
you're always watching people's faces because you want to see what they're up

722
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:58,750
to and that's why you have white surround your iris gorillas don't and so

723
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,780
that's because I can see exactly where your eyes are pointing because they're

724
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,800
highlighted by that white and I'm unbelievably good at detecting the

725
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,810
precise direction of your gaze and so if you stand on the corner and look up the

726
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:13,440
buildings other people will stand beside you and look up because they think well

727
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,789
that guy would be standing there pointing his eyes into the sky unless

728
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:20,590
there was something of interest to a primate like me and so this classic

729
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:24,250
social psychology experiment you'll get people gathered around trying to figure

730
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,300
out what the hell it is that you're pointing your eyes at right because that

731
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,490
indicates intense interest interest in something valuable that I might be able

732
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,149
to share partake in if I can figure out what it is that you're up to and so all

733
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:40,059
your ancestors who didn't have nicely defined eyes they all got killed or they

734
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:43,699
didn't mate and that's why you have these beautiful white eyes

735
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:47,439
with this like colorful iris in the middle it's so that people

736
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,570
can tell what the hell you're up to and they're more likely to cooperate with

737
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,960
you more likely to mate with you and less likely to kill you which is you

738
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,940
know probably a good thing all things considered and so you know if you look

739
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,019
at the same thing that someone else is looking at you're imitating them and one

740
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,440
of the things that's interesting is that if you're looking at the same thing that

741
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,209
someone else is looking at and you would have at the same value structure then

742
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,039
your emotional responses are going to be very much akin to one another and you

743
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:18,940
can tell that when you go to a movie and you watch the hero and you embody the

744
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,880
hero while you're doing so and the emotions that you produce inside of you

745
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,680
by imitating the hero on the screen enable you to figure out what the hero

746
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,699
is going through and you can learn from that and so that's a very complex form

747
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:34,629
of imitation and we do that when we tell stories or we watch stories and those

748
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:38,750
stories are really complicated because as we already outline they're not just

749
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,690
factual representations of someone's action during a day their

750
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,530
representations of the important things that the person did the meaningful

751
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,700
things and so when you go see a movie all you're doing is watching meaningful

752
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:56,000
things if the movies any good and you know that because well if the movie

753
00:52:56,001 --> 00:53:02,400
isn't meaningful well then you leave your board right it's and the fact that

754
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,849
it's meaningful is what keeps you in the seat and you don't necessarily know why

755
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,950
in fact you often have no idea why it's meaningful

756
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:13,598
it's like watching Pinocchio rescue is farther from a whale it's like what the

757
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,400
hell you know how I is that meaningful well you don't know but it is so moral

758
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,220
concerns well we already talked about Piaget is concerned about morality oh

759
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:40,559
boy this is really not good

760
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,420
okay here's a proposition constructivist proposition knowledge does not begin in

761
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,751
the eye by by which he means they're kind of two ways of looking at the world

762
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:54,820
there's more but we'll start with that one is is that all of your knowledge

763
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:00,349
comes from outside sense data okay and now that's kind of a behaviorist claim

764
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:05,650
and before that it's a it's an empiricist claim and then the other

765
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,550
ideas no that can't be right because you have internal structures that enable you

766
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:14,450
to look at the world and interpret it and so and and some of those might be

767
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:17,889
implicit axiomatic like the fact that you have two eyes and you look at the

768
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:21,639
outward into the world and that you can hear and that you can touch it's like

769
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,239
the fact of those senses isn't dependent on the empirical reality for those

770
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,629
senses to manifest themselves they're already built into you and people like

771
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,460
Kant for example made the proposition that we had a priori knowledge

772
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,269
structures and that we use them to interpret the world and so it's

773
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:40,159
different than him it's different than empiricism and so what

774
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,319
Piaget is saying well it's neither of those are right exactly it's not like

775
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,580
you will learn everything from the world through your senses and it's not as if

776
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:53,000
you project everything onto the world as interpretation it's something in-between

777
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,980
and it's a dynamic it's a dynamic and so and it's like bootstrapping

778
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,920
that's the right way to think about it you know when your computer boots up

779
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,510
that means bootstrapping its off and then a bunch of simple

780
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,750
processes occur and then out of those simple processes some more complex

781
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,608
processes emerge and then out of those some more complex processes emerge and

782
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,009
all of a sudden your computer is there well that's kind of what Piaget thinks

783
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,620
happens to you you bootstrap yourself and so you have got a couple of reflexes

784
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:23,250
to begin with like the sucking reflex for example and you've got some

785
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,699
proclivities like maybe you can sort of flip your hand or or you develop that

786
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:32,250
and you have reflexes so you know if you blow on a baby for example a baby you'll

787
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:37,000
go like this it's built into it it's like an it's a it's a startle reflex

788
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,039
essentially so that startle reflex is there right from the beginning so whole

789
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:44,550
body reflex and you know if you stroke the bottom of their feet their feet will

790
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,440
sort of curl up and if you put your finger in their hands even a newborn if

791
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,338
you put your finger in their hands you can lift them right up and it's sort of

792
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:57,029
well clinging ape you know because chimpanzee infants

793
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,420
cling to their mother for like five years and so without reflux is still

794
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,869
there so the kid comes into the world born with these simplistic low

795
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:10,858
resolution procedures that enable it to get a foothold on the world and then out

796
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:16,519
of that the child emerges and that's so the constructivist idea is that well it

797
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:20,969
isn't like you have your heads full of fully developed axiomatic structures and

798
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:24,419
it isn't that you get all your knowledge from the world it's that you have a bit

799
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,900
of structure there to begin with that gives you a toehold on the world and

800
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:33,650
then you act in the world and as you act you generate information and out of that

801
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:38,099
information you make the structures inside of you and you make the world

802
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:42,230
that's a constructivist idea is that you take whatever's there this tremendous

803
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:48,400
complexity and you sort it into you and the world and so and so that that goes

804
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,480
back to that William James idea about that initial chaos and it's a hard

805
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,760
conflict it's a hard hard concept to grasp because that isn't really how we

806
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,400
think you know we think that there's an objective world and there's a subjective

807
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,760
world and that the objective world is just there and the subjective world is

808
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,040
maybe a subset of that but that is not piagetian presupposition it's not a

809
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,179
presupposition of phenomenologist sin general who we'll talk about later

810
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:18,460
but so here's one example of how to think about this in a sense it's like

811
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,619
you know you think as Piaget said you kind of think that your representations

812
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:24,869
of the world are fixed so we'll go back to the you're in a long-term

813
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:29,640
relationship and the person betrays you a scenario right so you've been with

814
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,920
this person 10 years you assume fidelity and faithfulness and honesty and all of

815
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,108
that you you weave a shared narrative you both inhabit that it structures your

816
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:43,369
existence and regulates your emotion then you find out that the person has

817
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:48,519
not only betrayed you once but multiple times it's like okay what you thought

818
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,630
isn't what happened but here's the weird thing you see because you interpreted

819
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,720
the world obviously within the confines of that relationship and you hadn't you

820
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,480
know obviously you had an interpretation but there was also a world that's the

821
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,320
world you thought you lived in it's like those were facts well all of a sudden

822
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,480
those aren't facts they're not at all facts and so what happens that's that

823
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,380
descent into the underworld it's like all of a sudden what happens is that

824
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,619
past that you thought was fixed now becomes this weird mixture of fantasy

825
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:25,289
because you're wondering what what what what is it that happened then and you're

826
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:30,369
gonna run through all sorts of fantasies some of them are gonna be really dark

827
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:33,400
you know really dark about what happened in the state of the world and all that

828
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,849
and those are unconscious fantasies and that's mingled inextricably with the

829
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:42,450
world right because you don't know the facts anymore which kind of suggests

830
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:46,250
that maybe you never did know them and that's pretty strange thing because you

831
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,880
know you're operating as if you've got this factual representation of the world

832
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,900
but it can be upended like that and so that makes you think well what about

833
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,720
these facts like they're kind of they're kind of hard to get a handle on you know

834
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,969
and you see this a lot in court room in courtroom situations because of course

835
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:09,019
what the court decides is what happened and the answer is we don't exactly know

836
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:14,969
because you can keep making the context of interpretation wider and wider so you

837
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:18,769
know maybe you bring your partner to court because they've betrayed you let's

838
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:21,780
say and you're trying to get a divorce settlement predicated on that but then

839
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,790
they tell a bunch of stories about how you were just as miserable as you could

840
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:28,420
possibly be and that anybody with any sense would have betrayed you and never

841
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,760
told you about it because you know that's just what a normal sensible

842
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,460
person would do and so then the question is well were you actually betrayed and

843
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,550
if you were well who was it that betrayed you was that your partner was

844
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,550
it you or is it your bloody mother or your father who taught you act that way

845
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:47,220
or who didn't teach you it's like it's a hell of a thing because you can just

846
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:52,250
keep altering the interpretive context and within it the facts shift around and

847
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:56,900
then you might say well they're not facts it's like yeah yeah you can say

848
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,010
that but it's it's more complicated than that by a large margin

849
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:08,410
anyways so PJ's notion is essentially that well this is how I interpret it

850
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:12,489
this is sort of this is my thinking in some sense but I'm offering it to you as

851
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:17,159
a scheme for helping you understand Piaget it's like junior Rome Bruner

852
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:22,269
famous famous cognitive psychologist said we seem to have no other way

853
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:27,869
of describing live time SEP except in the form of a narrative and a narrative

854
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:32,710
as far as I could tell I think this is the same thing as one of PS J's

855
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,970
knowledge representations as far as I can tell there's a representation of you

856
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:40,469
and there's a representation of the future and there's behaviors that you

857
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:45,439
use to transform one into the other and so when Piaget talks about so this is

858
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,960
kind of where the mind meets the body that that's how it looks to me it's like

859
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,338
you have a conception of you and you have something you're aiming at you want

860
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:56,170
to have happen those are both representations but when

861
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,331
you act in the world those aren't representations anymore those are

862
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:03,720
actually actions and some of mine transforms into body when you act out

863
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:07,480
your notion and that's that's sort of how the mind is linked to the body as

864
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,460
far as I can tell and so what Piaget says is that the behaviors are built

865
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:18,260
before the representation and so we're going to take a look at that so here's

866
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:24,990
here's a Piaget a notion of assimilation and accommodation whereas other animals

867
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:27,639
cannot alter themselves except by changing their species

868
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:32,139
so that's through Darwinian means right so what happens is a bear is a kind of

869
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:35,179
solution to a set of problems and they're the problems that the bear's

870
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:38,559
environment presents and the bear is just a bear so it's sort of like bears

871
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,159
were ten thousand years ago and the only way the bear can solve a new problem

872
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,949
basically is by generating new random bears which is what it does wouldn't

873
01:01:45,949 --> 01:01:49,960
reproduce us and hoping that one of those more random bears is a better fit

874
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,470
for whatever random change might occur in the environment that's the whole

875
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:57,829
Darwinian issue right you can't predict which way the environment is going to go

876
01:01:57,829 --> 01:02:01,130
and so what you do is you take your structure and you vary it and you throw

877
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:07,000
those out into the world and some animals do that expensively so they have

878
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,119
infants that they have to program to that specific environment but it takes a

879
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:14,989
lot of investment and some creatures do that cheaply like mosquitoes it's like

880
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:17,809
they don't care for their kids but they have a million of them so like who cares

881
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,130
if nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety eight die there's

882
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:25,280
still twice as many of you as there were so those are two different reproductive

883
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:30,450
strategies and you could think about all those mosquito offspring as new mosquito

884
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:34,779
ideas in embodied form and most of them are bad ideas and so the environment

885
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,859
just wipes them out Opia Jays point is we do the same thing

886
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:40,769
with our cognitive structures and that's the thing that's so interesting about

887
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:45,489
people in some sense that we've internalized the Darwinian problem and

888
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:48,969
so when you think about the future what you're doing is generating a

889
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:53,379
multiplicity of potential environments and then you're generating a sequence of

890
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,730
avatars of yourself to live in those fictional futures and then you watch

891
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:02,460
what happens as that Avatar lives in each of those those fictional futures

892
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,010
and if the Avatar fails you don't act that out it's bloody brilliant it's

893
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,461
brilliant that's what our brain does it's like it

894
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:15,118
hypothesizes potential futures it runs simulations and it kills them and that

895
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,349
can be really painful but it beats the hell out of dying yourself or maybe

896
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:22,750
sometimes you won't think so because it really can be painful but it's it's it's

897
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,179
something that as far as we know only human beings can really do right we

898
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:30,989
invent possible futures and invent possible future selves and kill them off

899
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:34,829
in our imagination and that's what you're doing in an argument that's what

900
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:39,750
an argument is it's like well here's an avatar a representational avatar you

901
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:43,730
know that's based on certain axioms and all articulated and you articulate yours

902
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,329
and we'll have them have a fight in which everyone survives we'll accept as

903
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:51,710
true and we'll move forward and act that out and you know arguments can be pretty

904
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:56,349
damn intense but hypothetically they're not as intense as acting out a stupid

905
01:03:56,349 --> 01:04:01,699
idea that's the thing right better to have some conflict and reach resolution

906
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:07,250
in an abstract sense than to embody your stupidity and die and so you know it's

907
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:27,119
sort of a trade-off between anxiety and and an annihilation or pain

908
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,650
whereas other animals cannot alter themselves except by changing your

909
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:33,650
species man can transform himself by transforming the world and construct

910
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,389
himself by constructing structures and these structures are his own they're not

911
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:43,179
eternally predestined either from within or from without also Piaget you know

912
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,019
he's well he's a constructivist he believes that there's something that

913
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,690
your biology brings to the table and and and sets up the parameters let's say

914
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,970
within which you can play games but within those parameters there's a very

915
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:58,569
wide range of games that you could play and so it's not a biological determinism

916
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:01,369
even though it's a biological framing and you can think about it like a chess

917
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:05,970
game you know let's let's assume that the rules of chess are biologically

918
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,219
determined just for the sake of argument you can still play a near infinite

919
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:12,939
number of chess games and so it's the same with you you come into the world

920
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,849
with a set of built-in axioms that's sort of your body and your nervous

921
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:20,570
system but you can play a very large number of games within that set of

922
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:24,200
frames and one of the things that's very interesting about that something that's

923
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:29,079
very mysterious to me is this is a game that I played before with students so

924
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:31,690
I'm gonna play it with you if you don't mind so we're gonna play a game you

925
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:37,730
ready okay you move first right exactly you don't know what to do right and

926
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,969
that's well that's so interesting because I basically made the

927
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:44,459
presupposition that you could do anything you're completely free and what

928
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,699
do you do you throw up your hands it's like you don't know what to do I'm so

929
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:52,329
free it's like free to do what well that's not freedom it's it's just

930
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:56,338
nothing but if I said well look what we're gonna do instead is when I move my

931
01:05:56,338 --> 01:06:00,380
arm right you're gonna move your arm right so let's do that okay so I'm gonna

932
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,809
go like that you're gonna good and then I'll go like that and then we'll have a

933
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:09,509
little dance yeah yeah so you can play a game like that with it with a kid

934
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:14,700
instantly and they like that they've got that man and so I've got so I've got

935
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:18,079
some pictures of that I'll show you that in a bit but even a newborn baby you

936
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,108
stick out your tongue they can stick their tongue out back and now do you

937
01:06:21,108 --> 01:06:25,088
think about that that's just absolutely mind-boggling that they can do that and

938
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:27,789
they really can they really do seem to be able to do that right at the moment

939
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:34,400
of birth and so you know you hear babies have no theory of mind it's like ah yeah

940
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,920
no they can imitate that's pretty bloody amazing man like you haven't seen robot

941
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,750
that can do that yet although there are robots now that you can teach by moving

942
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:48,320
their their arms you move their arms and then they'll do it and so you can

943
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,849
actually program them by moving them and then they'll just repeat it and so

944
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:55,329
they're getting damn close to imitation they're really getting close and then

945
01:06:55,329 --> 01:06:58,800
look the hell out man because they're gonna be imitating each other as well as

946
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,210
us and they're gonna do it so fast you just won't be able to believe it so

947
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:09,750
that's coming the organism adapts itself by but materially constructing new forms

948
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,900
to fit themselves into those of the universe where as intelligence extends

949
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,030
this creation by constructing mental structures which can be applied to those

950
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,180
of the environment that's that there are winny an idea that I just mentioned you

951
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:21,889
know the guys that are building the autonomous cars like they don't think

952
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:26,009
they're building on Thomas cars they know perfectly well what they're doing

953
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:30,690
they're building fleets of mutually intercommunicating autonomous robots and

954
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:33,161
each of them will to be able to teach the other because their nervous system

955
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:36,019
will be the same and when there's ten million of them when one of them learned

956
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:39,519
something all ten million of them will learn it at the same time so they're not

957
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,150
gonna have to be very bright before they're very very very smart because us

958
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,050
you know we'll learn something you have to imitate it's like god that's hard or

959
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,990
I have to explain it to you and you have to understand it and then you have to

960
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:55,239
act it out we're not connected wirelessly with the same platform but

961
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:59,549
robots they are and so once those things get a little bit smart they're not going

962
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:04,460
to stop at a little bit smart for very long they're gonna be unbelievably smart

963
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,789
like overnight so and they're imitating the hell out of us right now too because

964
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:13,150
we're teaching them how to understand us every second of every day the net is

965
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,710
learning what we're like it's watching us it's communicating with us it's

966
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,480
imitating us and it's gonna know it already knows in some ways more about us

967
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,209
than we know about ourselves you know there's lots of reports already of

968
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:30,649
people getting pregnancy ads or ads for infants sometimes before they know

969
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,170
they're pregnant but often before they've told their families and the way

970
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:37,850
that that happens is the net is watching what they're looking at and inferring

971
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,359
with its artificial intelligence and so maybe you're pregnant that's just

972
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,440
tilting you a little bit right to interest in things that you might not

973
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:47,879
otherwise be interested in the net tracks that then it tells you what

974
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,630
you're at what you're after it does that by offering an advertisement so it's

975
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:58,619
reading your unconscious mind so well so that's what's happening so

976
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:03,390
all right so what's the motive for development dis equilibria

977
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:07,940
that's a Piaget lien term well this is a life is suffering idea it's like why

978
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:13,979
learn something cuz you're wrong who cares it makes you suffer you care so

979
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:18,139
you know if you run out a little scheme in the world a little action pattern you

980
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,048
don't get what you want if you're especially if you're two years old you

981
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:25,319
burst into tears and cry and why is that it's because you don't know what you

982
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:27,730
don't know where you are and you don't know what you're doing

983
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:31,579
it's like time for some negative emotion it indicates that you're wrong and

984
01:09:31,579 --> 01:09:36,170
that's terrible in some sense because it all it almost always means that to learn

985
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:44,289
requires pain now I don't believe that exactly because people are curious you

986
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:48,939
know and to go out and be curious and to learn new things can be very exciting

987
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:53,698
and so what it seems to be is that there's there's a rate of learning

988
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:58,259
that's too fast and that hurts you that's what makes you cry but if you get

989
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,760
the rate just right you're just opening up enough novelty so that you can

990
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,199
benefit from the possibilities that gives you a dopamine kick fundamentally

991
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:11,159
you can benefit from the possibilities without being overwhelmed by the by the

992
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:14,229
unexpected element of it and you can tell when that's happening and this is

993
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:17,779
one of the coolest things as far as I'm concerned this is and I learned this

994
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:23,029
partly from Piaget it's like you know in order to withstand suffering let's say

995
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:26,948
your life has to have some meaning okay well that that means a bunch of things

996
01:10:26,948 --> 01:10:31,198
it means that part of the way that you overcome suffering is by making the

997
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,629
suffering into something meaningful and I don't mean that metaphysically I mean

998
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,529
it technically you made a mistake it causes you suffering you learn something

999
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:40,979
about it you don't make that mistake again

1000
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:44,979
it's real adaptation it's not it's not defense against death anxiety or

1001
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:50,279
something like that it's real adaptation but more importantly the reality that

1002
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,670
you learn through pain is the oldest reality will say it's it's really old

1003
01:10:54,670 --> 01:11:00,369
it's as old as nervous systems and so you've adapted so that you've learned to

1004
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:04,840
transform your knowledge structures in a way that will minimize your potential

1005
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,360
exposure to future pain they at a rate you can tolerate or maybe

1006
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,609
even enjoy and so what's happening is you don't actually like being static it

1007
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:19,549
bores you but you don't like being thrown into chaos it's like no a little

1008
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:23,390
bit of that's fine what you want is you want to be opening up your knowledge

1009
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:27,000
structures on the periphery to transformation voluntary transformation

1010
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,520
that's voluntary exploration and letting those things manifest a little bit of

1011
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,230
interesting chaos and so you have a little bit you put a little feeler out

1012
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:39,000
there that you're willing to let die and it comes apart and you gather a bit of

1013
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,920
information it comes back together stronger and you do that all the time if

1014
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,289
you're if you're smart and you're looking for new information foraging for

1015
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:50,600
new information and that means you keep taking little bits of yourself apart and

1016
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,250
reconstructing them and overtime that keeps you alive and active you know part

1017
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,479
of the reason you're alive is because you're dying all the time right all the

1018
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,409
cells in your body like if they don't die you get cancer and that that's it

1019
01:12:02,409 --> 01:12:07,170
you're done you're a very very tight balance between death and life at every

1020
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:11,020
every single level including the cognitive level and it's not that fun to

1021
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,980
learn something because you have to kill something you already know in order to

1022
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:17,519
learn it that's another piece yet in observation because you're always

1023
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,190
interpreting something within a structure and if that interpretation is

1024
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:25,488
wrong even in a microwave you have to kill that structure and it's a

1025
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:29,379
biological structure it actually hurts to kill it but maybe you can generate

1026
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:34,650
something new in its stead and if you get the dynamic right let the rate right

1027
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:39,439
then you find that exhilarating not painful and that's and that's well you

1028
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,399
can tell when you're doing that as far as I can tell you can tell when you're

1029
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,339
doing that because you're engaged in the world in a meaningful way and what your

1030
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,270
nervous system is doing is signaling to you that you're not in a static place

1031
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,489
that's death you're not in a chaotic place that's death your balance between

1032
01:12:55,488 --> 01:13:00,000
the static and the chaotic such that the static structures are transforming at

1033
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,310
exactly the right rate to keep you on top of the environmental transformations

1034
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:10,030
and so you're surfing you know in Hawaii the surfers surfing was sacred well

1035
01:13:10,029 --> 01:13:14,909
that's why it's like do you can you tell someone how to surf well you can't

1036
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:18,340
because they have to go out there and dynamically interact with the wave but

1037
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,819
they can stay on top of the wave and that's

1038
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:24,509
what you have to do and if you're staying on top of the wave properly then

1039
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:29,460
it's exhilarating and that's the kind of meaning that that it rejuvenates you

1040
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,760
literally it makes you able to tolerate the suffering in life and it's not

1041
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,300
metaphysical precisely it's because that is what you're doing at that moment

1042
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,250
you're you're overcoming your limitations and of course that's what

1043
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,289
you have to do in order to to know and to learn because you want to be doing

1044
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:48,439
both of those things at the same time that's what you do when you play a game

1045
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:52,460
properly your parents say it doesn't matter whether you win or lose this is a

1046
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:57,600
PSAT and observation it's how you play the game what does that mean well it

1047
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,159
means that you should play the game in a manner that increases the probability

1048
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:05,609
that you're going to be invited to play many games in the future perfect so you

1049
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:09,130
master the skills of the game but at the same time you master a set of meta

1050
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,650
skills which is the skills that remain constant across transforming sets of

1051
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:18,079
games and that's what it means to play fair that's a bloody basis of morality

1052
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:23,680
as far as Piaget was concerned it's so damn smart you know because you think

1053
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:29,539
all interactions have this game-like quality they're sort of bounded and but

1054
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:33,659
there are commonalities across all the games and you want to extract out the

1055
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:37,170
commonalities and you want to learn to inhabit the universe that's made out of

1056
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:41,329
the commonalities between games and that's what it means to be a good person

1057
01:14:41,329 --> 01:14:44,880
roughly speaking you know it varies to some degree from culture to culture

1058
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,500
obviously because each culture is a game unto itself but there's something that

1059
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:55,119
transcends that that's the nature of games across game contexts and you know

1060
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,500
that you know that because you can tell the difference between a game and and

1061
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:02,300
something that isn't a game instantly everyone knows and it's not like there's

1062
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:09,770
only one kind of game there's hockey say and there's there's a world of warcraft

1063
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:14,581
I know it's way out of date but so am I so it's not surprising so but the fact

1064
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:18,569
that those things are very very different in many many ways doesn't stop

1065
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:22,519
you from identifying the underlying commonalities you know they're games and

1066
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,160
they're they're like stories in a sense so and that's a piagetian that's a

1067
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:36,050
piagetian observation very very smart so why do you develop well it's because

1068
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:40,920
your your previous idea their your previous frame micro frame let's say

1069
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,779
doesn't fit the circumstance and so something happens it you go like this

1070
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,149
what's up well the world isn't what you thought and there's something wrong with

1071
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:54,559
your knowledge structure this is partly what's makes Piaget a pragmatist you see

1072
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,730
the pragmatist American school of philosophy William James and his

1073
01:15:57,729 --> 01:16:01,500
followers they knew that we had bounded knowledge we don't have infinite

1074
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,340
knowledge and so they thought well that means we can't really be right about

1075
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:09,579
anything because we're definitely wrong and so how is it that you can operate in

1076
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:15,210
the world given that you're always wrong and the answer is you you set up a

1077
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:20,170
procedure that has rules for what constitutes true within the procedure

1078
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:24,170
itself so you play a game and at the same time you set up the rules so you

1079
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:30,109
might say well is this joke funny and then the answer is well do people laugh

1080
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:34,299
now when I tell the joke do they laugh and if the answer is yes then it's funny

1081
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,380
enough you've you've you've taken a particular definition of funny you've

1082
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:45,310
transformed it into a local phenomena and if your behavior matches the

1083
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:48,580
prediction in that local area you say well that's true enough is it like

1084
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:53,460
transcendently funny well maybe you'd have to tell it to 200 different groups

1085
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,220
of people to figure that out but mostly it's it's funny enough so that when I

1086
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:00,460
predicted what would happen when I told the joke that's what happened and you

1087
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,670
don't predict it by the way you desire it it's not the same thing because

1088
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:08,680
prediction has no motivation in it but desire does and we're always motivated

1089
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:15,320
always always motivated so well here's a way of thinking about the Piaget teen

1090
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:22,170
system so two-year-olds they're very chaotic and they bounce between one

1091
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:26,840
highly motivated emotional state to another and so the first thing that the

1092
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:34,279
two-year-old has to do is get his or her act together more or less inside and so

1093
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:37,159
you know two-year-olds still have tantrums and they still cry a lot and

1094
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:40,899
and they still run around like mad being joyful crazily which you have to train

1095
01:17:40,899 --> 01:17:43,809
out of them right away because it's nothing but disruptive and it's one of

1096
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:46,199
the most painful things about being a parent

1097
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:51,839
like 90% of the time you're going stop having fun stop having fun you know and

1098
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,279
then you turn into a teenager and your parents get what they ask for and so but

1099
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:01,840
because positive emotion is so impulsive and so chaotic it's really hard to

1100
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,650
manifest itself it's manifested within it within a predictable environment and

1101
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:10,659
so you're dampening down your child's enthusiasm non-stop it's but it has to

1102
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:14,979
be regulated because happiness is impulsive and chaotic and people don't

1103
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:18,750
like to think that because they think well we should be happy it's like Mannix

1104
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:22,930
are happy but they're maniacs that's where the word comes from like they're

1105
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:30,010
just you it's not good they're too happy way too happy like someone who's way too

1106
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:34,020
stoned on math or on cocaine and I mean that technically because it's it's

1107
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:39,410
they're very similar they're very similar biochemical states so and and

1108
01:18:39,409 --> 01:18:43,380
cocaine produces happiness pretty much in its pure form

1109
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:49,039
so does meth very rapidly and so it's just not good you know you lose judgment

1110
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:53,710
you happy people you don't have good judgment they're too happy maybe they

1111
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:58,930
get dopey it's like you know it's like irrational stock market bubbles oh boy

1112
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:05,380
it's always going to go up it's like no no it's not always going to go up but

1113
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:09,170
that's what you think when you're happy anyways the two-year-old has to get all

1114
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:14,719
these motivational systems sort of hammered into one thing internally now

1115
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,640
in some sense from the PIA jetty in perspective that happens within the

1116
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,680
child he thinks of the child is egocentric but and that that development

1117
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,800
takes place internally and then it's not till a child's let's say about three

1118
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,539
that it can learn to bring its controlled unity into a unity with

1119
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:35,019
another controlled unity and make a game that happens around three and so what

1120
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,930
happens is that instead of the child only pursuing his or her goals

1121
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:42,220
although modulated by the social environment the child is able to

1122
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,119
communicate with another child and establish a shared goal and that's what

1123
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:49,539
happens when they play and so obviously you play Monopoly that's what you're

1124
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:54,000
doing but when you play peekaboo you're doing the same thing it's like

1125
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,350
with your parent you're actually playing with object permanence dad's go on

1126
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:02,520
oh look dad's here haha he's there dad's gone that's here yeah

1127
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,360
it's gone dad's here like a kid man you can do that for like

1128
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,059
three hours they never get tired of it because every time you reappear it's an

1129
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:15,640
it's a miracle unis watch babies it's so funny like you go like this and they go

1130
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:20,420
then you talk back holding like they're so happy they're just overjoyed and then

1131
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:24,220
you take yourself away and they're like what's going on what's going on bang you

1132
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:28,739
reappear they don't have a real memory you know it's like reality is

1133
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:33,879
manifesting itself in all its freshness moment by moment and and they can't

1134
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,529
remember there are neurological conditions that do that so sometimes and

1135
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:40,170
there are people who that this has happened to so they get hippocampal

1136
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,569
damage and so they can't move short-term information into long-term

1137
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:48,269
storage and there's this one guy it's very interesting case he was a concert

1138
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:52,810
pianist and he had hell of a neurological injury and he could still

1139
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:56,850
play the piano he couldn't remember eight he couldn't he had amnesia and he

1140
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,770
couldn't move information from short-term storage into long-term

1141
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:04,160
storage so as far as he was concerned it was it was always like ten days before

1142
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,250
he had his accident he never got passed out he was stuck in that moment and then

1143
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,420
but he could still play the piano and but was so interesting you watch him

1144
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:14,510
there were films of him before he sat down to play the piano he'd have like a

1145
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:18,760
seizure and then he could play the piano procedural memory that was intact and

1146
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,480
then at the end he'd kind of have a little seizure and then he'd go back to

1147
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:26,029
being who he was but he had these notebooks and all he did was write in

1148
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:30,619
them over and over the same thing it's as if I have never seen this before it's

1149
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:35,179
as if I've never seen this before it's as if I've never seen this before

1150
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:39,760
so he's in this ecstatic state where everything was novel and new and pure

1151
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,820
and paradisal but there was no continuity and so when his wife would

1152
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:47,949
come to visit him he would just be overwhelmed to see her overwhelmed every

1153
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:51,289
time and even if she just left the room and came back in it was exactly the same

1154
01:21:51,289 --> 01:21:55,779
thing it's just like the kid it's like no object permanence and every time the

1155
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:59,949
face appears it's it's a staggering and you can see that in the reflexes of the

1156
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:04,300
child and that's that's without object permanence and so that's what Piaget was

1157
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:09,500
talking about with regards to object permanence it's very very cool so

1158
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,270
anyways the two-year-olds a collection of these sort of random motivations more

1159
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:16,020
or less gets his or her act together by about three

1160
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,540
if they're being socialized properly and that means that the parents are doing

1161
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:25,179
their best to make the child acceptable to other children that's your damn job

1162
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:30,670
as a parent you have to understand that because if your child isn't acceptable

1163
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:35,000
to other children they won't play with your child and then your child will be

1164
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,488
lonesome and isolated and awkward and they will never recover because if the

1165
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:43,238
kid doesn't get that right between two and four it's over

1166
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:46,488
they're never gonna learn it the other kids accelerate forward that kids left

1167
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:50,289
behind and it's not a good life for that kid they don't learn how to play with

1168
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:54,890
others and then they're done and there's a huge literature on trying to rectify

1169
01:22:54,890 --> 01:23:00,900
antisocial children say from the age of four on it's like no you can't and you

1170
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:05,409
can go ahead and read three four hundred papers on rectification of antisocial

1171
01:23:05,409 --> 01:23:08,948
behavior and figure it out for yourself but I did that for about five years and

1172
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:13,109
it was a while ago but I know the literature hasn't changed so you got to

1173
01:23:13,109 --> 01:23:17,529
get it right between that period you got to get the kid together enough so they

1174
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:21,679
can control themselves well enough so that they can adopt a mutual frame of

1175
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,640
reference with a peer so that they can start using that to scaffold their

1176
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,660
development further and become more and more sophisticated in social

1177
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:32,399
interactions and that's what you're you're acting as a proxy for the social

1178
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:36,739
environment as a parent that's what you're doing now a gentle proxy an

1179
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:42,239
informative proxy maybe even a merciful proxy but a proxy nonetheless because

1180
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:45,099
they're not going to be around you forever they're gonna be out there among

1181
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,100
people who don't really care about them and if they don't have something to

1182
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:52,610
bring to the table at least the ability to cooperate they're gonna be lonesome

1183
01:23:52,609 --> 01:23:57,479
and isolated and that's not going to be good well here's an here's an here's an

1184
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:01,939
idea so as you're moving from what is to what should be you're in this little

1185
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:05,879
frame of reference this little game this little Piaget alien game sometimes you

1186
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,250
get what you want or predict that's on the left-hand side that makes you happy

1187
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:14,710
and it validates your frame so if the frame keeps working across different

1188
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:19,390
circumstances you get a reward from that the reward produces a dopaminergic kick

1189
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:23,210
that makes you feel good but the dopamine also enhances the strength of

1190
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:26,670
the circuitry that underlies that particular representation that's what

1191
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,270
reinforcement is it's different than reward reward is

1192
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:34,460
what you feel let's say roughly speaking reinforcement is the effect of the

1193
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:39,090
dopamine bathing the neurological tissues to make it stronger and grow and

1194
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:42,840
so if the neurological tissue underlies a sequence of actions that produces a

1195
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,569
desired outcome there's a biochemical kick that strengthens the nervous

1196
01:24:47,569 --> 01:24:51,179
structures that were activated just before the good thing happens and so

1197
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:54,720
that's how something you know that's valuable gets instantiated and if it

1198
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:00,949
fails instead you get punished pain anxiety and that that starts to

1199
01:25:00,948 --> 01:25:05,259
extinguish that circuitry and we don't know how that works exactly we don't

1200
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:09,079
know exactly if those circuits then start to die because they can degenerate

1201
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:13,429
across time or if what happens is you build other circuits that inhibit them

1202
01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:17,230
so it's like you've got this knowledge structure it's built into you and once

1203
01:25:17,229 --> 01:25:19,509
it's there there's not really much getting rid of it but you can build

1204
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,541
another one that tells it to shut up that's sort of what happens when you're

1205
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:27,090
addicted to drugs so cocaine bathes the tissue that was

1206
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:30,420
active just before you took the cocaine with dopamine and so that gets stronger

1207
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:34,090
and stronger and stronger and stronger and so you're basically building a

1208
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:38,630
cocaine seeking monster in your head and that's all it wants and it has

1209
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:43,609
rationalizations and it has emotions and it has motivations and it's alive but it

1210
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:47,270
wants one thing and the problem is once you build that thing especially if you

1211
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:50,769
nail it a couple of hundred times with the powerful dopaminergic agonist like

1212
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:55,880
cocaine that thing is one vicious monster and it's alive and it's in there

1213
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,960
and you can't get it to go away the only thing you can do is build another

1214
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,710
structure to shut it up but the problem is is that as soon as you get stressed

1215
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:07,750
it interferes with that new structure and the old thing comes popping back up

1216
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:14,189
not good I wouldn't recommend it and the faster acting those dopaminergic

1217
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:19,139
agonists are cocaine is a good example but so is math the faster they hit you

1218
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:23,400
which is often why people inject them instead of snorting them say the faster

1219
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:28,750
that transformation from steady state to dopaminergic path the bigger the kick is

1220
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:33,579
and so you know so speed of introduction of the substance matters which is why

1221
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:37,899
you drink shots instead of drinking say wine or beer because alcohol has you

1222
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:41,359
know very similar very similar effects so

1223
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:52,559
all right so if you get what you want well then you feel good but not only do

1224
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,140
you feel good but the frame itself is validated and if you don't get what you

1225
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:59,530
want well then not only do you not get what you want but the frame itself

1226
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:03,090
starts to come apart at the seams and the question part is how far should the

1227
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:07,110
frame come apart how deeply should you unlearn something when you make a

1228
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:12,738
mistake god it's a very very very hard problem and I'll show you a partial

1229
01:27:12,738 --> 01:27:17,269
solution to it this very useful thing and this is a pia jetty an idea - let's

1230
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:24,000
see yeah I'm gonna go to this for a minute so so I'm gonna decompose

1231
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,329
something for you and and this is partly to give you an introduction to the way

1232
01:27:28,329 --> 01:27:33,710
behaviorists think but it's also to help unpack how the pia jetty in oceans work

1233
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:37,829
and so from a piagetian perspective high-order abstractions are actually

1234
01:27:37,829 --> 01:27:42,600
made of what's common among actions and perceptions so and those things are

1235
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,660
unified in some sense so an abstraction isn't what's common across sets of

1236
01:27:46,659 --> 01:27:50,738
objects it's more like what's common across sets of perceptions and actions

1237
01:27:50,738 --> 01:27:54,539
and so that's a hard thing to understand but but this will help you understand

1238
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:58,698
okay so let's say you want to be a good person it's kind of abstraction all

1239
01:27:58,698 --> 01:27:59,960
right and then you think well what does it

1240
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:06,510
mean to be a good person it's a box it's an empty box no it's a box and it says

1241
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:09,890
good person on outside but it's full of things it might even be full of

1242
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:14,560
transforming things so but you know what it means you say good person you kind of

1243
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,720
know and you kind of know but you know if we started talking about details we

1244
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,490
might start to argue but it's like pornography you know what when you see

1245
01:28:20,489 --> 01:28:24,519
it okay so what does it mean to be a good person well we could decompose it

1246
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,160
we could say well if you're one way of being a good person is to be a good

1247
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:32,238
parent and you basically say that being a good parent is a subset of being a

1248
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:37,309
good person right because person is bigger than parent and maybe it'd be to

1249
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:41,410
be a good employee and to be a good sister and to be a good you know to be

1250
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:46,869
to be a good good partner sort of on the same level of abstraction so you

1251
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:51,279
decompose good person into your major functional roles let's say and you're

1252
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:55,960
good at all of them whatever that means well let's say if you're a good parent

1253
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,060
well you have to have a good job because otherwise you starve and so do your

1254
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,640
children so at least you have to financially provide in some manner

1255
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,869
that's a subset of being a good parent it's not the only subset and then to be

1256
01:29:06,869 --> 01:29:10,399
a good to have a good be a good parent you also have to take care of your

1257
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:16,199
family and so you could decompose that into play with baby or complete meal you

1258
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:20,800
might say well if take care of family you can either order a meal or you can

1259
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,550
cook one it's like good for you and so then you're cooking a meal and you think

1260
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:29,070
well what do you decompose that into well now you're starting to get to the

1261
01:29:29,069 --> 01:29:33,619
micro level say because let's say you're making broccoli so you take the broccoli

1262
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:38,029
out of the fridge and you put it on the cutting board that's actually action

1263
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:42,119
that's not abstraction it's actually something you're doing with your body so

1264
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:46,460
the abstraction grounds itself out in micro activity actual action that's the

1265
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:51,130
connection between the mind and the body and so you're cutting broccoli right but

1266
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:55,929
that's not abstraction and so if you take apart these higher-order moral

1267
01:29:55,929 --> 01:29:59,369
abstractions what happens is you decompose them into action perception

1268
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:03,439
sequences and they're embodied now Piaget is basic claim is you build the

1269
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,939
dam abstractions from the bottom up that's his that's the fundamental Pia

1270
01:30:07,939 --> 01:30:11,889
jetty and claim it so the kid comes into the world with some reflexes and starts

1271
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:16,640
building a body of embodied knowledge out of that interaction with other

1272
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:21,320
people and then they start playing games and that abstracts but but they move

1273
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:25,029
from the bottom of the hierarchy which is actual micro actions up to the top of

1274
01:30:25,029 --> 01:30:29,920
the abstraction world and so it's this is how you boot yourself up little bitty

1275
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:36,219
stories what little bitty stories at the bottom cut broccoli you know and then

1276
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:40,219
cut corn here set table do dishes complete meal take care of your family

1277
01:30:40,219 --> 01:30:46,219
be a good parent be a good person and you know one of the propositions that I

1278
01:30:46,219 --> 01:30:49,640
am offering you in this class is that to be a good person you're actually not

1279
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,850
stuck in one of these to be a good person means that you're the thing that

1280
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:56,910
transforms these things continually and so that's what's at the top of the

1281
01:30:56,909 --> 01:31:00,569
hierarchy and that's basically the hero story which is you're in a state of

1282
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:05,279
being and it normally occurs you allow it to demolish you and then you rebuild

1283
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:09,529
and that's at the highest end of the moral hierarchy and that's also a sense

1284
01:31:09,529 --> 01:31:14,759
reappears Yeti and claim so so let's think about emotional regulation because

1285
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,989
this is a really good schema for understanding emotional regulation how

1286
01:31:18,988 --> 01:31:22,409
upset should you get and how do you calculate it because if you make a

1287
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:26,420
mistake you wake up in the morning in your side hurts okay you it's the first

1288
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,699
symptom of pancreatic cancer you're dead in six months

1289
01:31:28,698 --> 01:31:35,989
100% chats or you know you pulled a muscle well which is it you might say

1290
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:40,000
well the chances of the pancreatic cancer or low but they're not zero and

1291
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,739
like infinite times any proportion is a very large number so you might be

1292
01:31:44,739 --> 01:31:48,439
thinking why don't you just have a screaming fit any time ever any little

1293
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:51,539
thing happens to you which is exactly what happens by the way if you're two

1294
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:56,619
years old right that is what you do so and it's because you don't know you

1295
01:31:56,619 --> 01:32:01,219
don't know like things fell apart what does that mean could be anything well

1296
01:32:01,219 --> 01:32:05,699
that's no good well so let's say you're arguing with your with your partner you

1297
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:09,859
know and they I don't know if they make a lousy meal or maybe no meals and

1298
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:15,339
you're kind of sick of it you know and so you say you're a bad person and

1299
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,090
what's the evidence not only are you a bad person but you've always been a bad

1300
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:23,720
person and the probability that you're going to improve in the future looks to

1301
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:28,719
me to be zero it's like what's the person supposed to do punch you right

1302
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:34,529
really because there's no room in there for any discussion you're done it's like

1303
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:39,349
you're horrible and you don't change and you've always been horrible and you've

1304
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:43,570
never changed and you know inferring from that into the future

1305
01:32:43,569 --> 01:32:46,969
you're gonna stay horrible and you're not going to change well any argument

1306
01:32:46,969 --> 01:32:51,110
can go there immediately it's a really bad idea and it happens all the time and

1307
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:59,619
this is why people can't have a civil discussion you know they can't say

1308
01:32:59,619 --> 01:33:02,609
here's an example so you've got your four-year-old you want them to clean up

1309
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:09,179
their room and so it's full of toys let's say they're three and a half you

1310
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:13,010
look at it you say look you know clean clean this up clean up your room so you

1311
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,440
shut the door and you go away and you magically hope that when you come back

1312
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:18,719
the room will be clean but of course the child has no idea

1313
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,779
in all likelihood at that age or maybe it's two and a half something like that

1314
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:24,630
they know what clean up a room means that's

1315
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:29,600
like way up here man it's like you told your child there's mass every be a good

1316
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,960
person you know and then you come back in half an hour and they're no better a

1317
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,670
person than they were and you get upset it's like you can't do that you have to

1318
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:43,210
say you see that teddy bear and you know that that kid knows how to see a teddy

1319
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:46,319
bear and they know how to pick it up because you've watched them see a teddy

1320
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:49,460
bear and pick it up and you know that the child knows the name of the teddy

1321
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:54,130
bear it's teddy bear and so you point to the teddy bear and you say do you see

1322
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,989
that teddy bear and they go yes and you say that's good

1323
01:33:56,988 --> 01:34:00,750
pat pat and they get a little kick of dopamine so that's happy day for the kid

1324
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:04,461
and then they smile at you so you feel pretty good about that too and then you

1325
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:08,380
say you think you could pick up that teddy bear and they say yeah and so they

1326
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:12,409
go over there not every kid by the way but they go over there and they pick up

1327
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:15,619
the teddy bear and it's like it's a good day for both of you and then you say you

1328
01:34:15,619 --> 01:34:18,409
see that little space on the shelf because you know they know what a shelf

1329
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:22,479
is and you know they know what a space is and you say take that teddy bear and

1330
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:25,619
put it in the shelf and then go over there and they put it in the shelf and

1331
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:28,960
then they look at you and you're smiling and so the probability that they'll do

1332
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,159
that again is now increased because but watching you smile produces a

1333
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:36,220
dopaminergic kick and you've just strengthened those circuits so I would

1334
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:40,739
highly recommend that you do that with your children and with your partners

1335
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:46,029
right you watch them like like a sneaky person and every time they do something

1336
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:49,819
that you actually want them to do you notice and you give them a little pat on

1337
01:34:49,819 --> 01:34:54,488
the head yeah and then they like you that's cool but if they don't if you

1338
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:58,139
don't want them to like you because you hate them and then you won't do that but

1339
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:01,219
and you think well I don't hate them it's like oh yes you do you just think

1340
01:35:01,219 --> 01:35:04,850
about the last month man there's been twenty times you absolutely hated them

1341
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:09,550
and maybe that's the predominant emotion and that's not so good over time so when

1342
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:13,079
they do something good if you really want to screw things up watch like a

1343
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:16,969
hawk and wait till they do something good and then punish them that's really

1344
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:21,969
fun that is that really messes with them and people do that all the time so if

1345
01:35:21,969 --> 01:35:26,010
you really want to mock things up you can even do it more subtly you can wait

1346
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:28,720
till they do something good especially if they've never done it before and

1347
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,780
they're just kind of tentatively trying it and then you can ignore them that's a

1348
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:36,488
really good what that's even better than punishing them because at least when you

1349
01:35:36,488 --> 01:35:38,948
punish you're paying attention if you ignore

1350
01:35:38,948 --> 01:35:43,219
them it's like that's that's just perfect also takes hardly any effort on

1351
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:48,219
your part so that's an additional plus so anyways so if you're having a

1352
01:35:48,219 --> 01:35:51,429
discussion with someone it's like what you're doing with this kid you know it's

1353
01:35:51,429 --> 01:35:55,340
like you say maybe you're negotiating about meals you don't start with you're

1354
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,949
a bad person let's way the hell up here you know you blow the whole person

1355
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:02,819
schema right out from underneath them and you might as well get divorced which

1356
01:36:02,819 --> 01:36:06,359
is what will happen if you keep doing that soon you'll roll it your eyes at

1357
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:09,658
each other that means you're getting divorced by the way so if you ever watch

1358
01:36:09,658 --> 01:36:12,649
it he does I'm serious there's good empirical data on that once you're at

1359
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:17,899
the eye-rolling stage there's no going back so you should intervene way before

1360
01:36:17,899 --> 01:36:24,399
that it's discussed that AI role once you've hit disease-carrying rodent

1361
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:30,908
status in your mates eyes there's no coming back so anyways so what you do if

1362
01:36:30,908 --> 01:36:34,448
you want to have a conversation with someone that's a corrective conversation

1363
01:36:34,448 --> 01:36:41,579
is you sort of take a piagetian attitude and the attitude is go to the highest

1364
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:45,579
level of resolution that you can manage so let's say and that's what you're

1365
01:36:45,579 --> 01:36:48,899
doing with the kid it's like clean up your room be a good

1366
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:51,819
person it's like no they don't know any about anything about that but they do

1367
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:54,960
know how to pick up a teddy bear and then maybe you think cleaning up your

1368
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,899
room is a hundred things like that and so you have to teach the child each one

1369
01:36:58,899 --> 01:37:03,299
of those hundred things and then they learn this is the scheme they learn

1370
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:08,179
what's the same across all of those different actions that's clean right

1371
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:12,440
pick up the teddy bear put away the Legos make your bed what those have

1372
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:16,729
nothing in common really like the motor outputs completely different but they

1373
01:37:16,729 --> 01:37:20,609
fall under the heading of clean but unless you fill the heading of clean

1374
01:37:20,609 --> 01:37:24,119
with all the subordinate categories of the action perception sequences that

1375
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:28,229
make up clean kid can't do it and so partly what you're doing by attending to

1376
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:33,319
your child constantly is noticing where they are in the construction of this

1377
01:37:33,319 --> 01:37:37,238
hierarchy and they start way down here right and so that's why you play

1378
01:37:37,238 --> 01:37:41,370
peekaboo for example it's like they can do that and you can you know you

1379
01:37:41,371 --> 01:37:44,219
interact with them because you can watch you do a little something and if they

1380
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:48,100
respond you got some sense that you're you're at the same level and kids and

1381
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,829
playgrounds do that with each other right away so

1382
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:53,198
if you if you see two three-year-olds together say they're fairly

1383
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:56,389
sophisticated for three-year-olds what they'll do is they'll start playing a

1384
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:59,760
little primitive game with each other like door like a dog you know what a dog

1385
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,829
does what it wants to play it kind of goes like that and and that's what kids

1386
01:38:03,829 --> 01:38:07,019
do and that's what adults do too it's a plague

1387
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:10,489
it's play it if it tastes like I'm ready but you're smiling it's not like I'm

1388
01:38:10,488 --> 01:38:14,429
ready it's and so you can tell the difference between a play fight and play

1389
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,960
and kids can too so it's an invitation to play and so if you're interacting

1390
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,730
with your little kid they got that play circuit man that thing's in there like

1391
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:26,928
when they're from birth I think because you can play with a kid right from birth

1392
01:38:26,929 --> 01:38:30,449
at least something like peekaboo and so you're on the same wavelength

1393
01:38:30,449 --> 01:38:33,939
fundamentally and then you interact with them and you see if they're following

1394
01:38:33,939 --> 01:38:37,428
what you're doing is what I'm doing when I'm lecturing more or less I'm watching

1395
01:38:37,429 --> 01:38:44,670
you guys and seeing if we're more or less in the same shared space you know

1396
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:48,380
and we want the space to be expanding because if it's just staying the same

1397
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:53,279
well you might as well play whatever you play on your computer it has to be

1398
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,529
expanding at the same time that's optimal and so when you're playing with

1399
01:38:57,529 --> 01:39:01,119
your kid you put them on that developmental edge where they're undoing

1400
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:06,149
and then rebuilding their little skills you know you can do that like I had this

1401
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:11,259
memory from when I was a little kid a while back and I remembered I used to go

1402
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:15,570
over to these peoples house with my father and my mom and it was way up in

1403
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:18,420
northern Alberta and these people were Russian immigrants as children of

1404
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,500
Russian immigrants and they had a farmhouse way way out in the country way

1405
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,670
out by the way there where the railroad actually ended if you walk north from

1406
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:31,590
there you'd walk until you hit like southern Europe without fun running into

1407
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:34,710
another person it was way the hell out in the middle of nowhere and anyways

1408
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:38,600
they had a nice house it's like a warm house you know they had three kids and

1409
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:42,409
they were way older than me but it was a real fun comfortable place to go and I

1410
01:39:42,408 --> 01:39:46,170
used to sit in the living room with my father and his friend whose name was

1411
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:50,329
Nick and Nick was a really playful guy I really liked him he was like my

1412
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:54,579
surrogate grandfather and I used to I don't think I was more than about three

1413
01:39:54,579 --> 01:39:59,179
I'd sit there and I try to hit his foot with my fist and he would be talking to

1414
01:39:59,179 --> 01:40:02,569
my dad you know and my dad would say Jordan don't bother Nick and Nick would

1415
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:04,500
say well he's not really bothering me and

1416
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:08,810
his dad was checking it out to see if I was anoint were poor if I was a fun kid

1417
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:14,429
you know cuz it's a fine line and so I tried to hit his foot and he would move

1418
01:40:14,429 --> 01:40:18,760
it and now I had this memory while back and I thought wow that was a good memory

1419
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,050
and I thought what is going on there exactly and I realized well he's

1420
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:26,739
sharpening he was sharpening me up you know it's like I was aiming at something

1421
01:40:26,738 --> 01:40:29,489
you're aiming at something if you're pointing your eyes at it you're pointing

1422
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:32,439
your whole damn soul out it you're aiming at something and you're trying to

1423
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:36,589
get your behaviors and your conceptions in line and organized so that you can

1424
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:41,880
attain that aim that's what people do you know we throw rocks at things we we

1425
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:47,230
fire arrows at things we shoot guns at things we aim at things our whole body

1426
01:40:47,229 --> 01:40:51,549
is that platform for aiming and I was trying to aim at his feet and he'd move

1427
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:56,289
his feet you know but he'd let me hit it what now and then and so let's say

1428
01:40:56,289 --> 01:41:00,960
you're a rat okay because like I said it rats a good model for a person let's say

1429
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,869
you're a little rat a juvenile male and you want to play because you want to

1430
01:41:04,869 --> 01:41:08,399
play and you'll work to play and that's how we know you want to play if we're

1431
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,579
experimental psychologists because you're Bosch put button push like mad to

1432
01:41:12,579 --> 01:41:16,600
get access to an arena where you can wrestle with another little rat and so

1433
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:20,739
rats wrestle just like human beings and they even pin each other just like human

1434
01:41:20,738 --> 01:41:25,209
beings and they love that and so if you put little rat a in with a little rat B

1435
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:29,770
and little rat B is 10% bigger little rat B can stomp the hell out of little

1436
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:33,830
rat a all the time so they go out there and they have a little dominance

1437
01:41:33,829 --> 01:41:38,679
competition and little rat B is gonna win because he's bigger so now he's

1438
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:43,930
dominant rat so then they play in they wrestle and little rat a loses but and

1439
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,909
then next time they both know that little rat a is the inviter

1440
01:41:47,908 --> 01:41:52,000
because he's subordinate so he's the one who has to go up to the big rat and go

1441
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,020
you ready and the big rat then we'll wrestle however if you repeatedly pair

1442
01:41:56,020 --> 01:42:02,949
them and the big rat doesn't let the little rat win at least 30% of the time

1443
01:42:02,948 --> 01:42:06,799
the little rat won't invite him to play anymore and that was york panksepp who

1444
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:12,369
figured that out and that is mind-boggling because it tells you like

1445
01:42:12,369 --> 01:42:16,448
the bit there's a there's an ethical basis for play that's so deep that the

1446
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:20,969
damn rat and their rats not known for their sense of fair play

1447
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:25,029
the big rat has to let the little rat win 30% of the time or the little rat

1448
01:42:25,029 --> 01:42:30,059
will not play anymore and even rats know that it's it's so profound that

1449
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:34,230
discovery like banks have discovered the play circuit in mammals that's a big

1450
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:37,679
deal that's like discovering a whole continent like that's a big deal he

1451
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,909
should have got a Nobel Prize for that and to see that that's built in that

1452
01:42:41,908 --> 01:42:46,179
sense of fair play that's mind boggling you know cuz that's evidence for the

1453
01:42:46,179 --> 01:42:52,340
biological instantiation of a complex morality fair play even if you can win

1454
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,380
you shouldn't all the time well so when I'm trying to hit Nick's feet with my

1455
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:59,890
hand like I'm really paying attention and he's moving it pretty well but now

1456
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:03,610
and then I get to nail it and I'm feeling pretty good about that you know

1457
01:43:03,609 --> 01:43:07,109
and he makes a little bit more difficult all the time so that my aim gets better

1458
01:43:07,109 --> 01:43:10,849
and better and I'm building up my motor coordination I'm building up my social

1459
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:15,250
skills cuz I don't hit too hard and I don't cry when I miss because that just

1460
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:19,448
makes you annoying to play with right so I'm learning really complicated things

1461
01:43:19,448 --> 01:43:23,549
about how to go about finessing my aim and that's what you're doing with your

1462
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:28,650
kids and what are they aiming at well they aim higher and higher so when my

1463
01:43:28,649 --> 01:43:33,079
son was about two and a half we had him start setting the table it's you don't

1464
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:36,779
say you know you want to take grandma's fine china and go set the table

1465
01:43:36,779 --> 01:43:41,908
it's like no you don't do that you say you know what a fork looks like he goes

1466
01:43:41,908 --> 01:43:45,359
yeah see if you wanted the forks are well that doesn't work because the

1467
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:48,889
Drover's way up here right so you have to hand him a fork you say look take

1468
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:52,780
this fork and go put it on the table he's like this high you know so he goes

1469
01:43:52,779 --> 01:43:56,389
over to the table and he puts the fork up here can't even see what he's doing

1470
01:43:56,390 --> 01:44:00,600
he puts the fork up there and then you know he's reasonably happy with that and

1471
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:04,010
you could give him a path and then you go and give him a really sharp not no

1472
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:09,300
you don't do that you don't do that you give him a spoon and you say well go put

1473
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:13,670
the spoon beside the fork and you don't say look you're stupid kid you got to

1474
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:17,350
leave enough space between the fork and the spoon so the plate can fit there

1475
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:20,829
don't you know anything you're stupid it's like well that's

1476
01:44:20,829 --> 01:44:26,680
right up here right you're a bad kid no that's bad you don't do that you go down

1477
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:32,030
here and you say well good micro routine adaptation there Chum well

1478
01:44:32,029 --> 01:44:35,408
let's try it again you know when you build that up and like men

1479
01:44:35,408 --> 01:44:39,849
you can't extend the kid past its point his point or her point of exhaustion

1480
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,890
because it's got to be a game and a two-year-old can probably only do that

1481
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:48,700
for you can watch them and some are more persistent than others but 10 minutes 15

1482
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:52,349
minutes you pushing your luck you can take a two-year-old to a restaurant for

1483
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:58,370
about 40 minutes and expect them to sit and behave but after that you know

1484
01:44:58,369 --> 01:45:02,859
they're the will exhausts them all right well anyways that's Piaget in his

1485
01:45:02,859 --> 01:45:06,670
nascent form fundamentally and so if you if you remember that diagram and you

1486
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:10,390
think about how that would be built from the bottom up and how there would be a

1487
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:14,180
stage transition every time those things are learned you kind of got the

1488
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:20,170
essential elements of piagetian theory so we'll see you Thursday

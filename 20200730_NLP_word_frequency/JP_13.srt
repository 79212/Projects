[CLASSICAL MUSIC]

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:18,460
We've discussed the big five traits: extroversion, that's sensitivity to positive emotion.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,440
Neuroticism: it's sensitivity to negative emotion.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,640
Not all negative emotions. Mostly fear, anxiety, and emotional pain seem to load on neuroticism.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,899
Disgust, which is another negative emotion.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,820
It seems to be more associated [COUGHS] with conscientiousness, particularly its orderliness aspect.

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,299
Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness.

8
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,919
We're going to talk about agreeableness today.

9
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:50,019
Agreeableness is a very difficult personality dimension to understand, I think.

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,120
Partly because it's difficult to dissociate from neuroticism, and as well from extroversion.

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,379
Because agreeable people like you, and so that kind of sounds like extroversion.

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,939
And disagreeable people sound like they're hard to get along with. And they sort of are.

13
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,920
But people who are high in neuroticism are hard to get along with too.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,140
And they tend to be volatile and irritable.

15
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:23,620
And so most of the time, if you're engaged in a contentious issue with someone, and emotions flare, it usually has more to do with trait neuroticism than with disagreeableness per se.

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,680
So what I'm going to do is try to describe to you what the agreeable trait is, on both of its dimensions.

17
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:39,079
And also to lay out the pros and cons of existence on that normal distribution trait at more or less every point.

18
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:49,500
Because I think, the way I look at it anyways, is, of all the traits, agreeableness is the one that seems to come with the most marked positive and negative aspects.

19
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,819
Features, let's say, so we don't confuse it with aspects.

20
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,179
The most positive and negative features at each point on the distribution.

21
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,460
It seems to be a very, very complex dimension.

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:09,139
So, I'll read you some of the questions from the Big Five Aspects Scale and that will give you an initial rule-of-thumb estimate about whether or not you're agreeable or disagreeable.

23
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,280
And so here are some of the questions.

24
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,259
Imagine that you're answering these for yourself on a scale from one to five, strongly disagree to strongly agree.

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
So the first question is:

26
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,079
I'm not interested in other people's problems.

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,160
So, if you are interested in other people's problems, that tilts you towards agreeableness.

28
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,139
Agreeableness is divided into compassion and politeness.

29
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,059
Which also sound like very positive things, right?

30
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,960
Because everyone wants to be compassionate, and everyone wants to be polite.

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:49,260
And so you might say, "Well, is that a virtue? Are those virtues, with the other end being actually negative, to be not compassionate, not polite."

32
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,079
It's certainly worded that way.

33
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,739
And that's actually a mistake, because we know that these traits are normally distributed, roughly speaking, right?

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,159
And that that means that there has to be positive and negative features at every single position on the distribution.

35
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:24,159
And so to make the pre-supposition, for example, that being extroverted is better than being introverted, or that being emotionally stable is necessarily better than being neurotic, is to make a kind of confusion of moral obligation with trait position.

36
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,859
You have to assume that there's advantages and disadvantages all the way along, or the distribution wouldn't have set itself up that way.

37
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,680
Especially because these things seem to be biologically instantiated traits.

38
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,520
So

39
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,379
Anyways

40
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:44,060
If you're interested in other people's problems, they like to unburden themselves to you, you care about them: that's a mark of compassion.

41
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,340
If you're more or less indifferent to other people's stupid problems and you wish they'd just get on with it, then you're less compassionate.

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,819
You're harsher and more, well, at the extreme, more callous.

43
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,939
Ah, let's see.

44
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,380
Respect authority.

45
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,000
That's politeness.

46
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,580
That's part of agreeableness.

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,740
Feel others' emotions.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,879
Compassion.

49
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,939
Inquire about others' wellbeing.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Compassion.

51
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,160
Can't be bothered with others' needs.

52
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,279
Take advantage of others.

53
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,879
That's disagreeable, obviously.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,860
Sympathize with others' feelings.'

55
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,540
Avoid imposing my will on others.

56
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,319
Wait for others to lead the way.

57
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay, I think all of those are associated with the trait agreeableness or disagreeableness.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,660
So let's think about this for a minute.

59
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,860
So I'm going to tell you how I conceptualize agreeableness.

60
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,900
The first thing you want to know is that women are more agreeable than men.

61
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,740
About half a standard deviation.

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:11,439
And that's approximately enough so that if you took a random male and a random female out of the population, and you tried to guess who was more agreeable, and you guessed the female, you'd be right about 60% of the time.

63
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,100
But what's interesting about that, and this is something also to keep in mind, about normal distributions, you know.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,819
Imagine you have normal distribution, so that most people are in the middle.

65
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,079
And then you have another normal distribution, male and female, and mostly they overlap.

66
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:32,120
But, you see, out here, and out here, they don't overlap at all.

67
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:40,780
And so, even though on average, men and women aren't that much different in terms of their levels of agreeableness by the group,

68
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:43,039
if you go out and you look at the extremes, they're very different.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,200
So all of the most agreeable people are women, and all of the most disagreeable people are men.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,320
And the thing is, the extremes are often what matter, rather than what's in the middle.

71
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,279
And so one of the ways that's reflected in society, by the way, is there's way more men in prison.

72
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,800
And the best personality predictor of being in prison is to be low in agreeableness.

73
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,300
It makes you callous.

74
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,599
Now, you might think, "What's the opposite of compassion and politeness?"

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,280
And the answer to that is, I think it's best conceptualized as a trading game.

76
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,139
So let's say that we're going to play repeated trading games.

77
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,959
And if you're very agreeable, then you're going to bargain harder on my behalf than you're going to bargain on your own behalf.

78
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,780
Whereas if you're very disagreeable, you're going to do the reverse.

79
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,739
You're going to think, "I'm in this trading game for me, and you're going to take care of your own interests."

80
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,500
Where an agreeable person is going to say, "No, no, at worst this has to be 50-50, but I'd like to help you every way I can."

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,879
Okay, so you kind of understand that.

82
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,180
Now the advantage to being agreeable, then, is that you're good in teams and you're very much likely to give other people credit.

83
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,279
The down side of being agreeable is that you're not good at putting forward your own interests.

84
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,739
And so one of the things that predicts salary across time, for example, is agreeableness, and it predicts it negatively.

85
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,100
And so it's part of the reason why women get paid less than men, and this is something for the women in the class to really listen to.

86
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,339
Because how you get paid across time depends on a very large number of things, right?

87
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,079
It depends on your skills and your abilities and your position and your social network and all of that.

88
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,399
But the other thing it depends on is whether or not you actually go ask for money.

89
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,440
Or maybe that you don't even ask.

90
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,240
Because actually, you don't ask for money.

91
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,060
You tell people that you need to be paid more or something they don't like will happen.

92
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,500
And I don't mean as a threat.

93
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,819
I mean that you have to be willing, when you're negotiating, to have an alternative.

94
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,439
You go talk to your boss, who isn't going to give you money, because everyone wants money, right?

95
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,819
It's a competitive game.

96
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:50,379
You're going to have to go there and say, "Look, here's what I do. Here's why it's useful. Here's why you have to give me more money. And this is my opportunities if you don't."

97
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:57,540
And then, you're not taking your boss's money anyway, because it's very frequently the case that he's working for a whopping big company.

98
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,360
But he needs an excuse to give you money because everyone's asking for money all the time.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,660
And so you have to put your case forward powerfully and disagreeably.

100
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:16,840
Now, you don't want to do it too disagreeably because then he's gonna think that you're a son of a bitch and maybe he's not gonna give you anything and maybe you'll get fired for being mouthy, and all of that.

101
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,419
And that certainly happens to people who are too disagreeable.

102
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,140
You gotta get the balance right.

103
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,519
But it's definitely the case.

104
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:31,759
And the other thing that happens to women that's also worth noting, and this is probably because they're higher in negative emotion, is they tend to underestimate their own utility in business settings.

105
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:43,500
Right, because if you're trying to evaluate what you're like, and you're more tilted toward negative emotion, then the things that you do that are wrong are gonna stand out more on the foreground than the things that you do that are right.

106
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:54,720
So if you go into a negotiation, and you're uncertain already, because you have self doubts, and then you're agreeable in the negotiation, what's going to happen is that you're not going to win as often.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,399
And winning, in a business setting, or in a career development setting, means more opportunity for promotion and more revenue generated.

108
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:13,799
Now, the downside of that, of course, is as you climb the business hierarchy, you also have to take on more responsibility, and that responsibility is sometimes unpleasant as well, especially to people who are agreeable.

109
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,559
Because you're not necessarily liked if you're in a position of authority.

110
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,779
And agreeable people really like to be liked.

111
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:27,899
It's their primary motivator because they're concerned about the maintenance of intimate, positive relationships.

112
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,139
That also makes them conflict avoidant.

113
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:39,180
Okay so now, you guys can think about this, but I'll tell you why I think the personality differences between men and women exist.

114
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,200
Now, these are speculative hypotheses, but they're reasonably well documented by the relevant literature.

115
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,460
So let's think about it.

116
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,019
The first thing we might think about is: what's the difference between men and women?

117
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
How do they differ?

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,320
Well the first thing we might observe is that if you look at personality differences between pre-pubescent boys and girls, they're not very large.

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,139
Boys and girls don't differ in terms of their trait neuroticism, for example.

120
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,700
What happens is that, when puberty kicks in, women's trait neuroticism rises and it stays higher than men for the rest of their life.

121
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,139
And this is why you see this reflected in the different kinds of psychopathology that beset the two sexes.

122
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:27,539
So men are over-represented in alcoholism, drug abuse, anti-social personality, and a host of learning disorders as well as attention deficit disorder.

123
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,399
And women are over-represented in depression and anxiety, primarily.

124
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,699
That seems to be tightly associated with higher levels of trait neuroticism.

125
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,740
Because if you're at the 95th percentile or higher, let's say, in trait neuroticism,

126
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,539
there isn't much difference between that and being somewhat prone to depression and anxiety.

127
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,220
And because the curves overlap, the curves aren't identical,

128
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:59,139
the normal distributions aren't identical for men and women, you tilt the women's curve to the right towards higher levels of neuroticism.

129
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,120
You go out and you look for the person in twenty who has the highest levels of negative emotion.

130
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,700
It's much more likely to be female than male.

131
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,759
Okay, so let's see if we can figure out why.

132
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,500
So, we're gonna tell you some basic differences between men and women and you can tell me what you think about it, if you agree or disagree.

133
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,859
Okay, first.

134
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Size differential emerges between men and women at puberty, right?

135
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,279
Because boys and girls are roughly the same size and roughly the same strength.

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
But men get bigger at puberty, when testosterone kicks in.

137
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,579
And more importantly, not only do they get taller and heavier, but their upper body strength is much higher.

138
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,919
And that's a real issue for combat, because human beings punch, and there's other animals that do that.

139
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,339
Kangaroos do that too, so we're not the only people that punch.

140
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,300
But we have clubs on the ends of our arms, and so that's how we defend ourselves.

141
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:55,279
And so if you have a lot of upper body strength, especially across the shoulders, and you're heavier, then you can step into the punch and it's a lot more devastating.

142
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,279
Now it is the case that, if you look at the statistics for physical altercations in marriage, women attack their husbands more often than husbands attack their wives.

143
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,539
Well, you think, "Why is that?"

144
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:16,299
Well, let's assume that there isn't any reason, other than both people in a relationship can get upset, and the women know that if they hit their husbands, nothing's really going to happen.

145
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,379
Right, because if you're a woman about that high, and your husband is, say, my height,

146
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:28,240
unless you hit me with an object or something that's sharp, the probability that you're going to do me any serious damage is pretty low.

147
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,339
You might hurt me.

148
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,539
But if I do the reverse, and hit you, and I really hit you then I might kill you.

149
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,620
And so, at least one of the reasons why women can be more physically aggressive in minor ways in a relationship

150
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,200
is because everyone knows, the wife and the husband equally, that the consequence of the physical aggression is much more limited.

151
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,379
So, men do more serious damage to women.

152
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,039
But women are more aggressive in relationships.

153
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,240
So that's interesting.

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,659
So ok, so there's a body size difference that's important,

155
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:59,559
a strength differential that's important.

156
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
Next thing, I think...

157
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,879
So let's assume that the reason that women are higher in sensitivity to negative emotion

158
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,539
is because the world is actually more dangerous to women, right?

159
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,040
Because that would be the most logical reason why there would be a

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,360
sex difference in something like fear sensitivity and punishment.

161
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,720
Well first there's the danger of physical altercation.

162
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,000
Second, there's the sexual danger.

163
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,280
So women become sexually vulnerable at puberty.

164
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,860
And why do I say vulnerable?

165
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,100
Well it's straightforward.

166
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,620
It's because the cost of sex for women is way higher than it is for men.

167
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,500
Or it certainly has been throughout our evolutionary history.

168
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,039
Because if a man has an unwanted sexual encounter,

169
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,980
well then he walks away and maybe he is persecuted by the the state or prosecuted by the state for it.

170
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,580
But if a woman has an unwanted, unwarranted, or incautious sexual encounter,

171
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,080
and she ends up pregnant,

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,840
then, well, in traditional societies, you're just done.

173
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,659
And even in modern societies that are rich like ours,

174
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:01,199
you're... it's a... I don't have to go into that.

175
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
It's big trouble.

176
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,579
No matter what you do about it, it's big trouble.

177
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,280
So being more nervous about that makes perfect sense.

178
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,799
But then, here's the last thing.

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,940
I think that women's nervous systems are not adapted to women.

180
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,300
I think women's nervous systems are adapted to the  mother-infant dyad.

181
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,879
Because you are not the same creature when you have an infant.

182
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:24,679
Not at all.

183
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,099
You're way more vulnerable.

184
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,039
And it's partly because you have to express the vulnerability of the infant.

185
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,779
And you also have to care for it.

186
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,679
Right, so, you think about an infant, especially under nine months.

187
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,339
So let's say, how are you going to be wired up if you're going to optimally care for an infant under nine months?

188
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:47,200
And I'm saying under nine months because women generally do the bulk of child care for infants who are under nine months old.

189
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,520
And part of the reason for that, there's a whole host of reasons, but part of the reasons for that, obviously,

190
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,740
is that they breast-feed.

191
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,100
But imagine what you need to be wired up biologically in order to care for an infant.

192
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,940
First of all, they're very demanding.

193
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,899
Right?

194
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,639
Because they're completely helpless.

195
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,779
And they're demanding twenty-four hours a day.

196
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,840
And it's quite an emotional load.

197
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,519
And an infant under nine months is never wrong.

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,700
Right?

199
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,340
What you do to an infant under nine months, is, when they're in distress, you always respond.

200
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,779
You never tell the infant, "Get your act together and stop whining."

201
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,279
Right?

202
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,559
Which you can do to a child that's eighteen months old.

203
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,559
You can start having that sort of conversation.

204
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,019
But under nine months, it's like, nothing is the infant's fault,

205
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,739
it's surrounded in an extraordinarily threatening world,

206
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,719
and you have to be responsive to what it needs, regardless of what you want.

207
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,060
And you have to be very sensitive to the threats that emerge in the environment.

208
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:51,019
And so I think the price that women pay for that ability to have an intimate relationship with infants in the very earliest stages of development

209
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,559
is that their nervous systems are actually wired so that they can perform that role optimally.

210
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,500
And the disadvantage to that is that having a temperament like that doesn't work that well when you're dealing with adult men.

211
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,339
Especially when you're dealing with them in a business environment.

212
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,100
Because it's not the same thing.

213
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,060
Not at all.

214
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,139
It's a competitive environment.

215
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,459
So agreeable people are compassionate and polite.

216
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,160
What are disagreeable people like?

217
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,399
They're tough-minded, they're blunt, they're competitive, and they won't do a damn thing they don't want to do.

218
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,820
So it isn't exactly that they're aggressive, although they will push you the hell out of their way if you're in the way.

219
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,860
They're not volatile like you are if you're high in neuroticism.

220
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,100
It isn't defensive aggression, it's more like predatory aggression.

221
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:36,939
It's dominance behavior.

222
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,899
And so for someone who's highly disagreeable,

223
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,279
they look at the world as a place in which they can compete and win.

224
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,779
And I'll tell you a story.

225
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,539
I have a friend.

226
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,840
I gave him my personality test, the Big Five Aspect Scale that Colin DeYoung developed, in my lab.

227
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,879
I knew he was a disagreeable guy.

228
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,939
By interacting with him.

229
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,520
I mean, he's even rude to people sort of spontaneously on the street.

230
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
I actually like him quite a bit.

231
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,600
He's very, very funny.

232
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,779
He's also very conscientious, so you can trust him.

233
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,220
But he's disagreeable as hell.

234
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,180
So I gave him this test because I thought it would be funny, and he came out as the most disagreeable person in ten thousand.

235
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,100
[STUDENTS LAUGH]

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,060
Reasonable in compassion, about thirtieth percentile, but point zero-zero-one in politeness.

237
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,619
So he's extraordinarily blunt.

238
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,059
He'll just say absolutely anything, no matter how horrible it is.

239
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,700
And he was often brought into corporations to sort of clean them up.

240
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:40,059
So if a corporation was tilting and not doing well, they'd bring him in to find out who the useless people were and fire them.

241
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:47,579
And I talked to him about that, because I had the mis-opportunity to have to not have graduate students in my lab, for example, that weren't performing well.

242
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,359
And I find it very, very difficult, to, you know, to dress someone down, and certainly difficult to fire them.

243
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,779
I just hate it because I'm actually quite an agreeable person, much to my chagrin.

244
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,680
And I asked him about that.

245
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,620
And I said, "Well, what do you do? You have to fire people all the time. How do you handle that?"

246
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,539
He says, "Handle it? I enjoy it!"

247
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,039
[STUDENTS LAUGH]

248
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,279
And I thought, "Wow, that's so interesting, that someone would have that response."

249
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,079
So I said, "Well, what do you mean you enjoy it?"

250
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,919
He said, "Look, I go into these companies, and I analyze the performance of groups of people.

251
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,340
Right, and in those groups there are people who are really striving, really trying hard and working, themselves,

252
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,299
really hard, and being productive. And then there's these people that are just doing nothing.

253
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,720
They're completely in the way. They don't carry their weight at all. They take advantage every chance they get.

254
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,539
And they're always whining about why they can't work. It's like, I find out who they are, I call them into my office, and I tell them exactly what they've been doing.

255
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,259
It's like, hit the road, buddy. You've had your run of it."

256
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,119
And I thought, "Oh yeah, okay, fair enough."

257
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,439
Well, I can tell you,  you know, I've had situations in my lab where I had under-performing graduate students.

258
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,799
And one of the things that was really awful about that was that it was really hard on the high-performing graduate students.

259
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:01,240
You know, because they felt that even being in the same category as the people who weren't working hard and pulling their weight devalued what they were doing.

260
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,759
You know? And that's exactly right.

261
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:08,579
And so this is also why there's a conscientiousness trait and an agreeableness trait.

262
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,759
Because conscientious people judge you on your accomplishments, right?

263
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,539
They don't give a damn about your feelings.

264
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:15,259
Not a bit.

265
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,440
It's like, "Are you doing the work, or not?"

266
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:25,779
Whereas agreeable people think, "Well, you know, your mother's sick, and you've got a bunch of family problems, and we all have to take care of each other."

267
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,819
"And it's no wonder that you're having a rough time."

268
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:32,039
You can't say that one of those attitudes is correct and the other isn't correct.

269
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,519
You can't say that!

270
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:37,679
There wouldn't be those two dimensions if there wasn't something correct about both of them.

271
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,720
But you can certainly point out that often they conflict.

272
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,179
You know, and so the demand for inclusiveness and unity and care,

273
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,380
and the demand for high level performance in a hierarchical structure- they're very different orientations in the world.

274
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:56,480
It's complicated for people who are agreeable AND conscientious.

275
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:09,759
And actually, I think often, that large corporations, large institutions of any sort, run on the un-heralded labor of people who are high in agreeableness and high in conscientiousness.

276
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,740
And they're disproportionately women.

277
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:18,120
My experience in large institutions has been that if you want to hire someone to exploit appropriately,

278
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,440
No, not appropriately..

279
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,120
If you want to hire someone to exploit productively, you hire middle-aged women who are hyper-conscientious and who are agreeable.

280
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:27,980
Because they'll do everything.

281
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,240
They won't take credit for it, and they won't complain.

282
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,780
And that's nasty.

283
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,559
And I think that happens all the time.

284
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,159
And so one of the things you have to be careful of, if you're agreeable, is not to be exploited.

285
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,619
Because you'll line up to be exploited.

286
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,679
And I think the reason for that is because you're wired to be exploited by infants.

287
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,300
And so, that just doesn't work so well in the actual world.

288
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:52,299
One of the things that happens very often in psychotherapy,

289
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,700
you know, people come to psychotherapy for multiple reasons.

290
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,900
But one of them is they often come because they're too agreeable.

291
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,899
And so what they get is so-called "assertiveness training."

292
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,560
Although it's not exactly assertiveness that's being trained.

293
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,920
What it is the ability to learn how to negotiate on your own behalf.

294
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,960
And one of the things I tell agreeable people, especially if they're conscientious, is

295
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,139
Say what you think. Tell the truth about what you think.

296
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,500
There's gonna be things you think that you think are nasty and harsh.

297
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,640
And they probably are nasty and harsh.

298
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,819
But they're also probably true.

299
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,960
And you need to bring those up to the forefront and deliver the message.

300
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,840
And it's not straightforward at all because agreeable people do not like conflict.

301
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Not at all.

302
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,619
They smooth the water.

303
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:39,239
And you can see why that is, in accordance with the hypothesis that I've been putting forward.

304
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,160
You don't want conflict around infants.

305
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,539
It's too damn dangerous.

306
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,019
You don't want fights to break out.

307
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,000
You don't want anything to disturb the relative peace.

308
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:58,660
If you're also more prone to being hurt, physically, and perhaps emotionally, you're also maybe loathe to engage in the kind of high intensity conflict that will solve problems in the short term.

309
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,400
Because it takes a lot of conflict to solve problems in the short term.

310
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,360
And if that can spiral up to where it's dangerous, which it can, it gets uncontrolled,

311
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,980
it might be safer in the short term to keep the waters smooth,

312
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,120
and to not delve into those situations where conflict emerges.

313
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,219
The problem with that is it's not a very good medium to long-term strategy.

314
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,980
Right, because lots of times there's things you have to talk about.

315
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,259
Because they're not going to go away.

316
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,840
And so partly what you do with agreeable people is, you get them to figure out- and they have a hard time with this too.

317
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,380
If you ask a disagreeable person what he wants, say, or she wants, they'll tell you right away.

318
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,220
They go, "This is what I want, and this is how I'm going to get it."

319
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,319
Agreeable people, especially if they're really agreeable, are so agreeable, that they often don't even know what they want.

320
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:51,059
Because they're so accustomed to living for other people, and to finding out what other people want, and to trying to make them comfortable, and so forth,

321
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:56,440
that it's harder for them to find a sense of their own desires as they move through life.

322
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:06,519
And that's not... look, there's situations where that's advantageous, but it's certainly not advantageous if you're going to try to forge yourself a career.

323
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,099
That just doesn't work at all.

324
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:09,079
So...

325
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,259
All right.

326
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,439
What else do I want to tell you about agreeableness?

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,259
Well, I can tell you a little bit about the regulation of aggression.

328
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:30,079
One of the things I studied, especially when I was in Montreal, was the development of antisocial behavior in children and in adolescents.

329
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:36,139
Antisocial children, so they tend to be aggressive, antisocial children tend to turn into antisocial...

330
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,579
It's conduct disorder, technically speaking.

331
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,819
Conduct disordered children tend to turn into conduct disordered adolescents.

332
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,319
And then they tend to turn into antisocial and criminal adults.

333
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,220
And so I can tell you little bit about how that progresses, I think, because it's quite interesting.

334
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,940
And it isn't what people generally think.

335
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,920
So, the first thing is, if you want to be criminal, the best way to do it is to be really low in agreeableness and really low in conscientiousness.

336
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,439
Because low in agreeableness means, "Things are for me and not for you.

337
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,839
And you're not going to get me to do a damn that I don't want to do, and I'll stand my ground."

338
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,539
And low in conscientiousness means you can do all the work and I'll sit back and take the benefits.

339
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:19,159
And so if you have someone who's really disagreeable, and really unconscientious, you have someone who's starting to border on psychopath.

340
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:29,599
And if you add high intelligence and high emotional stability to that, then you have someone who won't work but will reap the benefits, who doesn't give a damn about you, who is assertive as hell and who's smart.

341
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,180
And a person like that's also going to be charismatic because extroverted disagreeable people are kind of narcissistic.

342
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,460
But they're... they'll put themselves forward strongly.

343
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,000
And if they don't show any signs of fear, that also indicates that they're confident.

344
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,859
And it's easy for people to confuse that with competence.

345
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,119
And that's how psychopaths get away with what they're doing.

346
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,759
Although they have to move from person to person because their reputation will track them.

347
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,180
So anyways, back to the development of aggression in children, the development of criminality in adults.

348
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,100
Here's how it seem to work, at least in part.

349
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,019
It's more complicated than this, but I'll put in some of the sociological elements as well.

350
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,240
So

351
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,640
If you take

352
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:09,460
children

353
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:16,079
and you group them together in groups defined by age,

354
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,000
So let's say you have 30 two year olds, 30 three year olds, 30 four year olds, all the way up to eighteen.

355
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:31,560
And then you watch them interact, and you code their behavior for kicking, biting, fighting, and property theft,

356
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,140
then what you'll find is that the two year olds are by far the most aggressive of the lot.

357
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,920
So that's pretty interesting, you know, because you think,

358
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:42,819
"Well, children are naturally peaceful, and if they're aggressive it's because they learn it."

359
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:47,480
It's like, no, that's true for a small minority of children.

360
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,180
But there's a substantial number of children who are aggressive at two, by nature.

361
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,639
Most of them are male.

362
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,119
Now that doesn't mean most children are like that, because they're not, even if you look at two year olds, who are the most aggressive human beings.

363
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,059
Most two year olds aren't aggressive.

364
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,299
But some of them are.

365
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,920
And most of those are male.

366
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,340
Okay, so then let's say you identify this cohort of aggressive two year olds.

367
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,119
And you track them across time.

368
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,440
Track them for the next 2-4 years. Track them until they're four years old.

369
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:25,019
What you find is the vast majority of the hyper-aggressive male two year olds get socialized perfectly well.

370
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,259
So by the time they're four, they're temperamentally probably still more aggressive, but they become civilized little monsters.

371
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,720
So other people can tolerate them.

372
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:41,380
And that means that they've had parents, or peers, or educational experiences, that enabled them to learn how to interact productively with other kids.

373
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,600
And to bring their aggressive nature under control.

374
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,299
Some of that seems to be mediated by the opportunity to engage in rough-and-tumble play.

375
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,740
And that's one of the things that we know that that helps socialize rats, for example.

376
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,900
It's vital to them, but it also seems to really be good for socializing young kids.

377
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,120
And rough-and-tumble play, which is something that adult males particularly like to do with young kids, by the way,

378
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,059
not before nine months, because they're just too little,

379
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:13,059
but once they become ambulatory, and kind of puppy-like so that they're a little bit more robust, then you can play a lot with them.

380
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:18,639
And you can play with them right at the edge of danger, too, which kids, they absolutely go nuts for that.

381
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,500
They love that.

382
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,279
When I had little kids, I made this kind of wrestling ring out of these two couches that we had that would hook together.

383
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,399
And I'd bring them on there and, you know, toss them up in the air and catch them, you know.

384
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,740
Eight, ten feet- no, no.

385
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,219
[STUDENT LAUGHTER]

386
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,400
A foot in the air and catch them, and they'd go like this, and then, you know, I'd catch them, and they'd laugh,

387
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,000
and I'd throw them up and they're all freaked out and then they'd laugh.

388
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,559
So they're learning trust with that in the bodied way, and they're also learning,

389
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:51,980
and this is from stretching them out, and wrestling them, and twisting them around, and letting them pull on your hair and hit you, and all of those things,

390
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,220
they learn deep in their bones exactly what can hurt them and what doesn't.

391
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:03,660
And you want to kind of push them to the edge, you know, so that they can tell the difference between what hurts and what's still within the realm of the game.

392
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
And you do the same thing when they're wrestling with you.

393
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,279
So they learn not to, you know, awkwardly stick their thumb in your eye.

394
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:13,200
Or do things that are actually painful like grab your lip and pull it.

395
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,380
It's like, no, no, you let go of my lip, you know?

396
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,079
And so, that seems to help regulate the aggressive impulses.

397
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,099
And help the child find a more appropriate embodiment.

398
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,799
You can think that what you're doing, in some sense, when you're rough-and-tumble playing with kids is teaching them how to dance.

399
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,519
Because that is what you're doing.

400
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,079
You know? You're making them comfortable in their bodies in all of its extension.

401
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,599
And building in that kind of body fluency that you see in people who are well-situated inside themselves.

402
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,640
And so that's something to really think about, you know?

403
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,039
And it's appalling.

404
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,759
We know that the ability to engage in rough-and-tumble play among rats inhibits aggression, impulsive aggression, among rats.

405
00:28:51,920 --> 00:29:00,440
We also know that if you deprive rats of the opportunity to engage in rough-and-tumble play, they show pre-frontal cortical developmental deficits.

406
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,279
And manifest behaviors that are akin to attention deficit disorder, which you can then treat with Ritalin.

407
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:20,939
And so one of the things that's happening with boys, because they're way more dosed with attention deficit disorder medication than girls is that their natural proclivity to engage in robust and troublesome active play isn't appropriate for a school environment

408
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,380
where you're supposed to sit down and shut up.

409
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,160
And so the kids get hyperactive.

410
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,320
And instead of letting them out to run around until they fall over half exhausted, which is exactly what you should do,

411
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:40,220
you know, and you medicate them, so that their exploratory systems, the activity of which is facilitated by the dopaminergic agonist,

412
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,440
that's the ADHD medication, suppresses the play function.

413
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,620
It's absolutely appalling. There's no excuse for it.

414
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,140
You know, but it's a good indictment of the education system, because why in the world would you take six year old kids

415
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:59,939
and get them to sit without moving for five hours, unless you want them to grow up fat and stupid?

416
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,059
Why in the world would you train them to do that?

417
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,140
Well it's easier. That's one thing.

418
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:11,279
And when they're sitting there, there's nothing disruptive about the rough-and-tumble play, and that can be quite disruptive.

419
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,459
So anyways, most of these kids

420
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,099
are reasonably well socialized by the time they're the age of four,

421
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,659
using one mechanism or another.

422
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:24,200
They learn how to regulate their aggression and they learn how to engage in fictional play structures with other kids.

423
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,019
They learn how to cooperate and compete.

424
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:32,420
And the advantage to having a well-socialized disagreeable person is that they really don't let much get in their way.

425
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:38,460
So if you can get a kid who's disagreeable socialized, that person can be quite the creature, you know?

426
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Because they're very forward-moving in their nature and very difficult to stop.

427
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:50,840
But if you don't get them successfully "domesticated," tamed, roughly speaking, by the time they're four,

428
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,980
their peers reject them.

429
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,279
And that's a big problem because

430
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,259
your job as a parent is to make your child socially desirable by the age of four.

431
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,500
You want to burn that into your brain.

432
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,180
Because people don't know that.

433
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,299
That's your job.

434
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,259
And here's why, it's easy if you think about it carefully.

435
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:16,700
So you imagine, you've got a three year old child, so halfway through that initial period of socialization,

436
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,460
and you take that child out in public.

437
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,259
Okay, what do you want for the child?

438
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,619
Who care about you?

439
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,279
What do you want for the child?

440
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:29,219
You want the child to be able to interact with other children and adults,

441
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:37,960
so that the children are welcoming and smile and want to play with him or her, and the adults are happy to see the child and treat him or her properly.

442
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,420
And if your child's a horrible little monster because you're afraid of disciplining or you don't know how to do that properly,

443
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:51,339
then what they're going to do is, they're going to experience nothing but rejection from other children, and false smiles from other parents and adults.

444
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:58,759
So then you're throwing the child out there into a world where every single face that they see is either hostile or lying.

445
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:04,240
And that's not something that's going to be particularly conducive to the mental health or the wellbeing of your child.

446
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,359
If your child can learn a couple simple rules of behavior, like don't interrupt adults when they're talking too much,

447
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,459
and pay attention, and try not to hit the other kids over the head with the truck any more than is absolutely necessary,

448
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,759
and share and play properly, then when they meet other kids, the kids are going to try out a few little play routines on them,

449
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,660
and that's going to go well, and then they're going to go off, and socialize each other for the rest of their lives.

450
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:35,380
Because that's what happens, is that from four years old onwards, the primary socialization with children takes place among other children.

451
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,259
And so if the kids don't get in on that early,

452
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,680
they don't move into that developmental spiral upwards and they're left behind.

453
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,740
And you can imagine how terrible that is, because a four year old will not play with another four year old who's two.

454
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,380
But a five year old certainly will not play with a five year old who's two.

455
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,460
Right, because the gap is just starting to become unbelievably large.

456
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,980
And so the kids start out behind, and then the peers leave them behind,

457
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,620
and then those kids are alienated and outside the peer group for the rest of their life.

458
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,940
Those are the ones that grow up to be long-term anti-social.

459
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,259
They're already aggressive. It doesn't dip down.

460
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,679
Now what happens to normal boys, roughly speaking,

461
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,680
imagine the aggressive two year old types,

462
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,640
they get socialized, so their level of aggression goes down, and then they hit puberty, and testosterone kicks in, and bang!

463
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,480
Levels of aggression go back up.

464
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,319
And so that's why males are criminals between the ages roughly of sixteen and about twenty-five.

465
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:34,740
And it matches the creativity curve, by the way. It's so cool.

466
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,180
If you look at the spike of creativity among men, sixteen to twenty-five, it starts to go down,

467
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,840
criminality matches that absolutely perfectly.

468
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,880
So that's quite cool.

469
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:50,520
So the testosterone levels raise the average level of aggression among men,

470
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,619
more dominance than aggression, actually, and testosterone is by no means all bad,

471
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,779
and then it starts to decrease around age twenty-five or twenty-six, which is usually, with men,

472
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:10,160
stop staying up late at night, stop drinking as much, develop a full time career, and take on the burdens and responsibilities and opportunities that are associated with a long-term partner and family.

473
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:25,840
So that's the development of what I would call predatory aggression, because I also think that the agreeableness distribution is probably something like predatory aggression,

474
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
versus maternal sympathy.

475
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,380
It's something like that.

476
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:35,220
So if you look at other mammals that are predators, because we're predators as well as prey animals,

477
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,219
if you look at other animals like bears,

478
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,780
the male bear has absolutely nothing to do with the raising of the infants.

479
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,440
In fact, the female bears will keep the male the hell away because he's likely to kill the infants,

480
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,639
and maybe even to eat them.

481
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:54,759
So there's no maternality at all in solitary, male, mammalian predators.

482
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,800
Now it depends on how social they are, but roughly speaking, that's the situation.

483
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,940
Whereas with human beings, males are quite maternal.

484
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,800
So, but anyways, I think the extreme of agreeableness,

485
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,820
on the low end, so disagreeableness, is predation.

486
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,259
And the extreme on the upper end is maternal caring.

487
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,980
And those two things compete, right?

488
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,740
Obviously, it's very difficult to be both of those at the same time.

489
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,699
And so men, of course, in the wild, so to speak, are...

490
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,260
Very, very few women hunt

491
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,780
in modern societies or in archaic societies.

492
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,679
And you can also understand why that it because hunting actually requires hurting something, killing it.

493
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:41,839
And it's usually something that's not very impressed about being hurt or killed, and it will emit a lot of distress while it's happening.

494
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,039
And so for anybody who's compassionate, who's got compassion as one of the fundamental elements of their temperament,

495
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,439
that's something they're just not going to be able to tolerate at all.

496
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,840
In the evolutionary landscape, because that's really what we're talking about,

497
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,120
there's tension behind the development of different modes of being in the world.

498
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,420
And if you're good at one thing, that sometimes means that you can't be good at the other thing at the same time.

499
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,840
So...

500
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,559
I was going to have a guest speaker for you last week, but the person I had invited in had some familial trouble,

501
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,699
so that didn't work out.

502
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:20,619
She's a graduate student of mine and one of the things that we'd be working on in my lab, generally speaking,

503
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:26,219
is the delineation of the relationship between personality traits and political belief.

504
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,579
And so I told you a little bit about the things that distinguish liberals from conservatives, right?

505
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,559
The conservatives are high in conscientiousness, especially orderliness,

506
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,580
and low in trait openness.

507
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,679
And so that means a conservative is someone who puts someone in boxes, puts the boxes in order,

508
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,980
and doesn't like them to be messed up.

509
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:53,159
So they like the borders between things to remain determinate and what would you say,

510
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,400
inviolable.

511
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,599
And I think that's true at every level from the conceptual all the way up to the political.

512
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,620
I think that the fundamental political question

513
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,059
and I think this is why the temperaments align across these political dimensions,

514
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,779
is whether the borders between things should be open or closed.

515
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,439
We see this reflected worldwide right now in then arguments about immigration, right?

516
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,440
Because the liberal types are saying, "Open the gates."

517
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,539
And the conservatives are saying, "Wait, you don't know what you're inviting in."

518
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,139
And you might say, "Well, who's right?"

519
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,019
And the answer is you don't know.

520
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,139
That's the thing.

521
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:32,519
Because sometimes the right answer is, "Open the gates, these are interesting people, we could trade with them, we could learn from each other."

522
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:38,739
And sometimes the answer is, "Don't bother. What's going to come in is going to wipe you out and kill you, and really do it."

523
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,519
I mean, so, here's an example.

524
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,620
This is why I think orderliness is associated with disgust sensitivity.

525
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,159
And it's one of the determining factors of conservative political belief.

526
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,759
What happened when the Europeans came to North America?

527
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,300
What happened when the Spaniards came to North America?

528
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,179
95% of the Native Americans died.

529
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,340
Why?

530
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,399
Because the Spaniards brought illness.

531
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,980
Smallpox, measles, chicken pox, all these things that the Native Americans had absolutely no resistance to.

532
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,300
There were hardly any diseases at all in North and South America.

533
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,039
The Spaniards showed up, within 15-20 years, 19 out of 20 of the Native Americans were dead.

534
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,760
You never know what people are bringing with them.

535
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,420
And so what that means is that how should you respond to people who are outside of your circle of familiarity?

536
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,059
Well the answer is

537
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,840
One, they might kill you, in all sorts of ways .

538
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,440
Two, they might bring with them things to trade that are of inestimable value.

539
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,579
So you're stuck. It's like, how the hell are you going to reconcile that problem?

540
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:46,039
And the answer is, well we reconcile it temperamentally, roughly speaking.

541
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:56,280
So half the people are temperamentally wired up to say, "No, no, no! Let's keep the damn boxes closed. Took a long time to pack everything in there and to get it into order."

542
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:08,420
And the liberals say, "Well wait a minute. You don't know if you've got things in the right boxes to begin with. The things that you're keeping in there were getting stale and old. And maybe we need some new ideas and new people to rejuvenate the situation."

543
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,240
That's political discussion.

544
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:17,119
And the political discussion has to proceed because there's no way of solving that problem except by discussing it.

545
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,720
Well, how does that relate to agreeableness?

546
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,699
We also looked at political correctness.

547
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,039
And so here's an interesting thing.

548
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,179
Purely from a scientific perspective.

549
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:28,940
You might ask yourself,

550
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:36,440
If you talk about political correctness, one of the things that the people who tend to be labeled as politically correct say is

551
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,720
there's no such thing as political correctness.

552
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,120
It's just a pejorative label that people who are opposed to those views impose on a set of beliefs to demonize it.

553
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:49,699
Perfectly reasonable objection, and you never know, it might be true.

554
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:52,719
But the thing is, psychometrically, you can solve that problem,

555
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,279
and you solve it the same way that you solve the problem of what constitutes human personality.

556
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,940
So this is the way we tried to solve it.

557
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,940
You can think about it methodologically, because that's how you should think about it.

558
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:11,840
The first thing we did was collect a very large number of statements from press accounts that seemed to indicate what people generally referred to as political correctnes.

559
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,460
So we had a small team of people combing media reports

560
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:24,500
to come out with opinions or attitudes that looked like they were characteristic of the differentiation between politically correct people and people who aren't politically correct.

561
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,120
So we got about four hundred statements like that.

562
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:35,619
And what you want to do is, you imagine that there's a core set of beliefs and statements that people are defining in a particular way.

563
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,279
And you're trying to get a handle on what that is, and even if it exists.

564
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,019
What you do is over-sample it.

565
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:48,760
If you can find questions that might even tangentially be related to the phenomena in question,

566
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,100
you include those.

567
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,719
Because the statistics will take care of the excess.

568
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,440
Okay, so then what you do is you take your four hundred items, roughly speaking,

569
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,960
and you get people to register the degree to which they agree or disagree with them, get a thousand people to do that.

570
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,780
And then you subject that to a factor analysis.

571
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,519
And what the factor analysis does is tell how those questions clump.

572
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,260
Now, they might not clump.

573
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,560
So for example, you could do a factor analysis of a set of questions, and you could find that there are

574
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,440
two hundred factors, let's say you have four hundred items.

575
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,519
There's two hundred factors.

576
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,579
And none of them... there's no big set of questions that are clumping together.

577
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:35,500
And you say, "Well, there's no evidence here that there is a single, underlying phenomena that unifies those questions that you can reasonably characterize with a name."

578
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Well that isn't what we found.

579
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,220
We found that there were two dimensions of political correctness.

580
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,699
One of them looked like liberalism,

581
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:49,420
except that the people who were politically correct, in addition to being liberal, were very high in trait agreeableness.

582
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,079
And agreeableness has almost nothing to do with the classic liberal-conservative divide.

583
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:59,920
It's weakly related in that conservatives are more compassionate than liberals,

584
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,760
Sorry, liberals are more compassionate than conservatives, the difference isn't huge,

585
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,100
and conservatives are more polite than liberals, and the difference isn't huge.

586
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,960
So those are the two aspects of agreeableness.

587
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,699
If you put them together, they cancel each other out.

588
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,919
And so on average, conservatives and liberals don't differ in agreeableness.

589
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:22,139
But political correctness did clump together into two categories,

590
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,319
PC liberalism, we call it PC authoritarianism.

591
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,440
The PC liberals were high in openness,

592
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,740
high in verbal intelligence, and high in agreeableness.

593
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,519
And the second group was PC authoritarians.

594
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,919
And they were also high in agreeableness, but they were high in orderliness, and the correlation with that was negative in relationship to verbal intelligence.

595
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,639
So we found that there were two categories of political correctness, that it does in fact exist,

596
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,159
but that it's a very unstable construct because

597
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:57,759
factor one, which was PC liberalism, and factor two, which was PC authoritarianism, were only correlated at 0.1.

598
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:05,339
And so what it indicates, and this is our prediction, roughly speaking, from the lab, is to the degree that there's unity, so to speak, on the politically correct left,

599
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,019
it'll fragment into two groups.

600
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:18,180
One will be the PC liberals, and the other will be the PC authoritarians, because although they're united by their tendency to agreeableness, they're not united by other temperamental traits, nor in their core beliefs.

601
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,159
So the PC authoritarian types, for example, are very obsessed with language control.

602
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,559
And it's funny that it's agreeableness. I've really been thinking about that.

603
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,599
You know, again, this is a hypothesis in development, but I think what's happening is that

604
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:40,679
you know, your temperamental proclivity allows you to lay out a kind of radical simplification on the world.

605
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,960
That's part of the advantage of having a temperament.

606
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,000
So if you're a conscientious person, the world is a place to go out there and work.

607
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,840
If you're an open person, the world is a place to go out there to discover new ideas and do artistic things.

608
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,940
If you're an agreeable person, the world's a place to go out there and establish intimate relationships.

609
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:57,019
So they're simplifying

610
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,559
perspectives, and simplifying personalities.

611
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:07,759
They're the manner in which you're adapted to a particular niche.

612
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:21,200
I think what you see in agreeableness in relationship to political belief is a proclivity for people to divide the world into defenseless infants and predatory oppressors.

613
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:27,739
And that that's blasted forward onto the political landscape, and things are conceptualized along that temperamental variable.

614
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,860
Anyways, that's where we're at with regards to the analysis of political belief.

615
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:42,759
Well, we've got three minutes left, and I'm wondering if anyone has a particularly intelligent question or failing that, any question at all?

616
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:46,859
Because I told you a lot of things that are, I would say contentious.

617
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,160
But I also think they're very much worth knowing.

618
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,119
So I, yes?

619
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,940
Did you say that high in agreeableness is the simplified perspective of the mother-infant dynamic?

620
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,240
Yeah, that's what it looks like to me, yeah.

621
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,840
Projected onto the world, period. Yeah.

622
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,900
So what would you say is the best way to go about, knowing that we have these simplified ways of looking at the world, what then?

623
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:19,300
It's really useful to investigate the viewpoints of people who have opposing views to yours.

624
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,600
Because they'll tell you things, not only will they tell you things you don't know,

625
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,299
they'll also tell you how to see the world in ways that you don't see it.

626
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,639
And they'll also have skills that you don't have, that you could develop.

627
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:40,460
So for example, if you're an introverted person, it's very useful to watch an extroverted person, because the extroverted person has ways of being in the social world that aren't natural to you,

628
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,079
that you can use to improve your toolkit.

629
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:50,940
And if you're disagreeable, one of the best things to do with disagreeable people, especially if that's alienating them from other people, for example, because it can,

630
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:55,519
you know, people treat you like you're a selfish, arrogant son-of-a-bitch, and maybe that's because you are.

631
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,380
It's like, okay, so what do you do about that?

632
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:03,420
One of the most promising "treatments," let's say,

633
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,940
is get the person to do something for someone else once a day.

634
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,380
Just as a practice, and learn how to do it.

635
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,500
Maybe you can wake the circuit up, you know, if you think that it's lying dormant in you, which is probably right.

636
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,220
You know, I think we have a very wide range of propensities within us.

637
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,640
Some are switched on.

638
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,420
Genetic propensity. Some are switched on.

639
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:28,659
But I think that if you put yourself in the right situation or walk yourself through the right exercises, you can switch some of these other things on as well.

640
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:31,920
But it takes work and dedication and discipline to do it.

641
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,500
So actively confront the things which are not a part of our personality?

642
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:43,380
Yes. Well, I would say, generally speaking, if you want to adapt yourself properly to life, you should find a niche in the environment that corresponds with your temperament.

643
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,159
Right? You shouldn't work at cross-purposes to your temperament, because it's just too damn difficult.

644
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,099
But having done that,

645
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:57,980
then you should work on developing the skills and viewpoints that exist in the space opposite to your personality.

646
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,339
Because that's where you're fundamentally underdeveloped.

647
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:10,359
That way you can extend out your temperamental capability across a wider range, and to me that's roughly equivalent as bringing a richer toolkit to each situation.

648
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:14,460
You know, so if you're hyper-extroverted, you should probably learn to shut up at parties now and then.

649
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,079
And listen just to see what's going on, to see if you can manage it.

650
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:26,920
And if you're introverted, well then you should learn how to speak in public, and to learn how to go to parties without hiding in the corner and saying nothing to anyone.

651
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,159
And if you're agreeable, then you need to learn how to be disagreeable, so people can't push you around.

652
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,500
And if you're disagreeable, you need to learn how to be agreeable so that you're not an evil son-of-a-bitch, you know?

653
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,440
And the same thing applies even in the conscientious domain.

654
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,079
If you're too conscientious, you need to learn to relax and let go a little bit.

655
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:59,159
And if you're unconscientious, it's time, like, get out and Google "calendar," man, and start scheduling your day, right, and beat yourself on the back of the head with a stick until you're disciplined enough so that you can actually stick to something for some length of time.

656
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:05,500
And not living in absolute squalor, which is something that would characterize someone who is very disorderly, for example.

657
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,119
Because they just don't notice. It doesn't bother them, disorder.

658
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:16,819
It's like, maybe they can see it, but it doesn't have any emotional valence and so it doesn't have any motivational significance.

659
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:26,119
The other thing you might want to think about, too, if you're choosing a partner, is try not to choose someone who's too distant from you on the temperamental variables.

660
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,359
Because you're going to have a hard time bridging the gap.

661
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,619
You know, it's hard for an introverted person and an extroverted person to co-exist.

662
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:38,739
And it's really hard for an orderly person and a disorderly person to co-exist because they will drive each other nuts.

663
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,199
Why don't you pick up?

664
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,380
Why are you so obsessed by it?

665
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:44,179
That's the basic argument.

666
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:53,740
So it's useful to know about your temperament so that you can negotiate the space with your partner as well, and I don't think you should try to find someone who's exactly the same as you,

667
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:58,000
because then you don't have the benefits of the alternative viewpoint.

668
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,760
But you've gotta watch it because you may hit irreconcilable differences of various sorts.

669
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:09,280
And I've seen that most particularly among couples who are high and low in openness, that's a rough one.

670
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:17,719
And also high and low in conscientiousness, that's another rough one, because they just cannot see how the other person sees the world at all.

671
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:20,139
Okay, I'll see you on Tuesday.

1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,510
so we'll continue with our union analysis of the Lion King today we ended

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,570
at the point where remember Mufasa had taken Simba up to the top of Pride Rock

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,899
and described to him the fact that his kingdom essentially constituted

4
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,308
everything that the light touched and you can think about that as the domain

5
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:40,628
of the roughly speaking of the great father with the domain of the great

6
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:44,378
mother on the outside of that being symbolically equivalent to the

7
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:49,210
underworld or to death or to nature all of those things seem to be approximately

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,149
equally true and he forbade Simba from going to investigate what was beyond the

9
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,039
confines of the light and in some sense that's exactly what a tradition does for

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,478
you it because the tradition is precisely what defines the domain of the

11
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,129
light and to be moral from the perspective of the tradition it's akin

12
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:13,810
to playing a piagetian game but only adhering to the rules you know how

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,710
Piaget described the fact that when kids first master a game they learned they

14
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,339
learn how to act it out and then they learn what the rules are and then they

15
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,228
regard the rules in some sense as sacred you can't go outside the rules and then

16
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:29,468
later in moral development if they get to that stage then they start to

17
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:34,298
recognize themselves also as formulators of the rule or formulators of the game

18
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,859
and culture tells you don't go beyond the rules that's the definition of

19
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:42,578
morality within the box of culture and you don't go outside of that and so

20
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:47,978
that's why Mufasa plays that particular role and it's wise because if you go

21
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:51,759
outside the domain of what you already understand then it's dangerous out there

22
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,429
clearly it's dangerous out there but the downside of that particular message and

23
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,379
this is perhaps this is the mythological reason why Mufasa isn't as aware as he

24
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:05,280
could be of scar you know his knowledge is bounded and

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,209
he's no I'm not aware enough of what lies outside of that in this realm let's

26
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:17,759
say of death and destruction and so scar is he is able to overcome his his

27
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,629
brother one you see this sort of thing happening to people very frequently for

28
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,449
example who developed post-traumatic stress disorder

29
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,628
and one of the things that's not as well known about post-traumatic stress

30
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:33,818
disorder as might be known is a it happens to you if you encounter an

31
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:37,628
experience that sort of blows out the axioms of your knowledge system that's

32
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:42,129
one way of looking at it it's so unexpected that you can't account for it

33
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,060
within the confines of this of the system that you're using to interpret

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,568
the world that often happens to people when they encounter something that's

35
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:54,639
truly malevolent and that can be within them or it can be in the form of someone

36
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,809
else who is genuinely out to hurt them they're often people who develop PTSD

37
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:05,400
are often but not always somewhat naive and they're not aware of the full

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,090
catastrophe of the world that might be one way of looking at it and then they

39
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,390
encounter someone who's truly out to hurt them and they can detect that even

40
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,949
in in the way the person's face looks or they encounter a part of them that's

41
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,539
much more malevolent than they had ever imagined it could possibly be and then

42
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,780
they do something terrible and then they don't know what to do about it

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,049
so delay or the the Canadian General wrote a book called shake hands with the

44
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,829
devil and it was about what happened to him in Rwanda when he was stationed

45
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:46,239
there as a UN warrior or a UN soldier and I mean Dallaire was not naive but

46
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,099
what he encountered was truly malevolent and it just blew him into pieces and and

47
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:56,259
that that's what happens and so there's real utility and staying within the

48
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:00,608
bounded domain but the problem is is that there may be information that's

49
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,329
outside of that domain that you absolutely need to know and so part of

50
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,700
the problem with being alive is that you have to continually determine how much

51
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,379
you're going to maintain your stability and how much you're going to explore and

52
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,459
you have to explore because the stable part of you gets outdated but if you

53
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,788
explore too much or too too unwisely then you can encounter things that flip

54
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,060
you upside down it's actually one of the problems with being high and trade

55
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,660
openness especially if you're also high in neuroticism because if you're open

56
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,140
you're creative you're always looking for for ideas that are outside of your

57
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,248
current systematic way of thinking but if you're high in eroticism so you

58
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,338
parents a lot of anxiety and emotional pain and that sort of thing you can

59
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:46,538
continually upset your own apple cart now the other thing that you might want

60
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,868
to think about this is really useful as far as I'm concerned is you might want

61
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,589
to think about this politically and we've been doing a lot of work I'm gonna

62
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,778
have one of my graduate students actually come and talk to you about the

63
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:59,228
work we've been doing on personality and Paul and political belief so what

64
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:02,978
happens with political belief is that if you're high in openness and low in

65
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:06,128
conscientiousness you tend to be a liberal the openness being the

66
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,519
particularly important part of that and if you're low in openness and high in

67
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,110
conscientiousness especially orderliness you tend to be a conservative now it's

68
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,110
kind of strange because openness and conscientiousness aren't very highly

69
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,538
correlated so it's not obvious why those two traits would combine to determine

70
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:25,688
political belief and and the relationship is actually quite strong

71
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,329
between temperament and political belief if you measure political belief

72
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:33,009
comprehensively but it seems to me that the fundamental distinction and this is

73
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,968
the political game at least along the liberal conservative axis this boils

74
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:41,709
down to one thing it boils down to how open borders should be compared to how

75
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:46,329
close they should be and you know you can see that reflected for example in

76
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:50,348
the attractiveness of Trump to a large part of the general population because

77
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:55,329
he's going to close the borders build a wall and fortify the borders and

78
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:59,918
conservatives like that they like to have borders between things stay tight

79
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,149
and they don't even care if it's state borders or political borders or town

80
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:09,129
borders or ethnic borders or borders between ideas or borders between sexual

81
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:13,479
identities conservatives like to have things stay in the damn box where they

82
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:15,728
belong partly because they're orderly and

83
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:18,639
partly because they're lone openness they don't get any real they're not

84
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,168
interested in what happens if you free up your conceptions all they see in that

85
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,238
is the probability of disorder whereas liberals who are high in openness and

86
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:32,618
low and conscientiousness slash orderliness they get a real charge out

87
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,639
of letting things out of the box so that they can creatively interplay now the

88
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,489
issue is who's correct and the answer is you don't know because the environment

89
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:46,628
underneath the political landscape moves and so sometimes the right answer is

90
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,649
tighten up the borders and fortify and sometimes the right answer is no no

91
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:53,168
loosen things up because everything's good

92
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:58,568
to static and tight and we need more information and the dialogue that occurs

93
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,340
in the political landscape with this is why dialogue is so important is

94
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,269
fundamentally between these two opposing views of borders and because you can't

95
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:12,158
say with certainty which one is right at any given time an open dialogue has to

96
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:16,478
maintain itself so that the entire political State can maneuver properly

97
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,060
along that moving line it's absolutely crucial it's really really really useful

98
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,129
to know that people vote their damn temperament it gets you it gives you

99
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:30,610
more of an understanding at least in principle of your of those who sit on

100
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,598
the other side of you on the political fence and there's been recent newspaper

101
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,819
articles quite interesting I tweeted a couple of them about this company and UK

102
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,930
called Cambridge analytics and they're using the damn big five they can extract

103
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,918
out big five information from your Facebook Likes they've got a model of

104
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,348
every single person in the United States big five personality and they help Trump

105
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,759
craft political messages right down to the level of apartment buildings to

106
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,770
appeal to people based on their Big Five temperament and that's all recent work

107
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,579
and so one of the things that's very interesting is we are teaching computers

108
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:11,709
to understand us so fast you can't believe it and we really do risk walking

109
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:16,359
into an electronic world where you will only see what you want to see I mean

110
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,718
obviously the marketers are trying to do that as fast as possible right they only

111
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:23,228
want to send you ads that you're going to be interested in because it's

112
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:26,709
expensive and foolish to send you anything that will annoy you or that

113
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:31,778
you'll ignore and so the marketers are trying like mad to map who you are even

114
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,889
by watching your eyes they're trying to figure out who you are so they can send

115
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,098
you the right information but the danger is that that will happen say in the

116
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,060
domain of news and broader information increasing this tendency for people to

117
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,049
be siloed in their exposure to the external world it's a big sort of like

118
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:53,049
each of us is becoming a micro celebrity surrounded by electronic sycophants who

119
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:56,740
do nothing but tell us exactly what we want to hear it's a real problem

120
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,759
Karl Popper a famous philosopher science said that one of the things that you

121
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:04,990
should do and this is akin to the PIA jetty and view is you should always look

122
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,029
for information that contradicts your cur

123
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,449
viewpoint now that's painful right because who wants their axioms

124
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,890
contradicted it can take you apart but it's the only way that you can ensure

125
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,189
that you're learning at the same time that you're maintaining your stability

126
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,210
and that's another reason why it's really necessary to engage in dialogue

127
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,690
with people that you do not agree with because they're the ones who will tell

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,440
you things that you don't know it's crew it's crucial importance in the

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,770
maintenance of your own stability the worst thing that can happen to a person

130
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:36,340
know because there's many horrible things that can happen to a person but

131
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,759
one of the worst things that can happen is that you find yourself in a situation

132
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,710
where no one is offering you corrective feedback anymore because you rely on the

133
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,759
corrective feedback provided by other people to keep yourself sane to keep

134
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,450
moving in the ever-changing environment and if you cut yourself off from that

135
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,330
feedback then well then you end up static and shrinking it's really it's

136
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,389
really not good you get less and less competent you get less and less

137
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:06,039
confident and the threats outside of you loom larger and larger so that's all to

138
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:13,299
do with the you know the domain outside the light see young would also say that

139
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:17,439
out in this domain that sort of beyond what you understand that's also where

140
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,310
you encounter the archetypes of the collective unconscious now that's a

141
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:25,929
really really complicated idea but what he means by that is that if you're put

142
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:31,149
outside the domain of your competence you're going to start to use fantasy to

143
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,549
organize your world so I can give you an example of that so you you I presume

144
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:40,240
most of you are old enough to have a conscious memory of when the Twin Towers

145
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,129
came crashing down and so everybody in the days after that was wandering around

146
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,309
like they were in the days and the reason they were in the days is because

147
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:53,559
well it wasn't exactly clear what fell right there was the physical towers fell

148
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,189
but that was only a tiny bit of the problem because those physical towers

149
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,000
were embedded in a network of meaning like a very very sophisticated network

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,779
of meaning but also a political network and an economic network and a military

151
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,129
network and like they're they're nodes inside a very complex system and so when

152
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:13,629
they come crashing down you don't know what's come crashing down right so

153
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,990
you're out there in the unknown and and wondering what's going on and wandering

154
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,590
around in the days which is exactly what happened to people and then what bush

155
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,379
did George W was immediately turned that

156
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:28,419
into a good versus evil drama instantly and that's an archetypal idea so that's

157
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,009
when he came up with the idea of the axis of evil I think that was Iran North

158
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:38,080
Korea and I don't remember the other one at the moment but but he yeah he

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,230
immediately turned the political landscape into a good versus evil drama

160
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,230
and he said to everyone in the world that they were either with him or

161
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,269
against him fundamentally and that was the that was part of the retreating into

162
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:53,740
a I guess a more protected landscape that's one of the ways that human beings

163
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,570
deal with the encounter with a traumatic threat and so the reason you meet the

164
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,830
unconscious and even the collective unconscious on the border of your

165
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,670
knowledge is because when you hit the border of your knowledge you start to

166
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:12,399
use fantasy in order to bring the the newest form of order out of the unknown

167
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,409
so that you can start to make sense out of it and that's what artists always do

168
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,829
that's what they do and so from the Union perspective people who are engaged

169
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,639
in creative art are the ones who are on the perimeter of knowledge structures

170
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,710
and so what they're doing is taking the absolute unknown which would be in

171
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:34,060
Rumsfeld terms they're unknown unknowns and turning them into partially known

172
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:39,189
unknowns that's what an artist does and and especially the more classical

173
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,490
artists who deal with mythological and religious themes which was the case for

174
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,820
art right up until really until the late 20th century

175
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,470
they're they're using these mythological ideas to sort of extend the domain of

176
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,800
human knowledge out beyond its current parameters and so artists do that and

177
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,149
literary people do that and and dramatists do that and they help us

178
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,470
extend our knowledge now that's where open people live that's another way of

179
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,410
thinking about so think about it this way so you're in a city you know what

180
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,039
and the city has parts of it that degenerate and so you could think about

181
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,000
that as order degenerating into chaos and then the open people who are

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,379
creative come along and they find places in the city that have degenerated but

183
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,549
that still have interesting potential right and then they move in there where

184
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:28,509
it's cheap to and they start producing art they start producing galleries and

185
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,899
then the coffee shops move in and then the thing starts to get civilized and

186
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,490
then of course the more all conservative types move in those

187
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,389
would be the yuppies roughly speaking so they're they're much more conservative

188
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,929
than the artists but they're still liberal compared to the bulk of the

189
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:48,459
population and so the more daring people move in after the artists have civilized

190
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,269
it and then after that you know then the chain stores start to move in and soon

191
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,379
it's completely turned into Zellers or something like that and then the artists

192
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,370
have to go somewhere else and find another place on the boundary where they

193
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,230
can live and it's a fizzy elizacass much as a mental boundary and so you because

194
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,220
you think each of those personality traits there's five dimensions each of

195
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,480
them represent the possibility of inhabiting a kind of niche right an

196
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,769
ecological niche so if you're an extroverted person your niche is the

197
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:21,370
social environment if you're an introverted person the niches I think

198
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,820
nature I don't know that for sure because I've never figured out exactly

199
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,770
what introverts are adapted to but it's not exactly the social world if you're

200
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,789
agreeable then your niches relationships if you're disagreeable your niches

201
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:39,490
competition if you're conscientious your niche is duty and effort and so and and

202
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,230
that those niches are partly social because so much of our environment is

203
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,370
social but they're also partly natural because our social being is nested

204
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,000
inside the natural world and so you can think about the big five traits as

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,899
different kinds of adaptations to different kinds of niches and that's the

206
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,889
niche that the open people the open exploratory types occupy so that seems

207
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,250
to make a higher-order super factor extraversion and openness called

208
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,629
plasticity as opposed to stability which is conscientiousness agreeableness and

209
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,740
emotional stability and there's a play off between those two things because the

210
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,049
stable people obviously are stable but the plastic types of people are more

211
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,379
dynamic and they're they're more concerned with transformation and in

212
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:28,779
order to get a system optimally stable and dynamic you have to have a continual

213
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,889
interplay of those of those factors because static doesn't work because

214
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:36,939
everything changes that's the problem with conservatism and the problem with

215
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,839
liberalism fundamentally is yes everything changes but you have to bring

216
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,610
forward some structures from the past so it's very it's very very difficult to

217
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,789
get that balance correct so all right so anyways out there in the

218
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:56,379
underworld in the place beyond your current conceptualizations that's the

219
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:00,399
place of death and nature and it's beyond the light and it's also the place

220
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,450
of Hell and that's what you see here and what do you how do you conceptualize

221
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,470
that well one of the things you'll see if you're interested in this sort of

222
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,420
thing if you ever go read the writings of the Columbine killers the teens

223
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,769
they're very interesting they're very much worth reading especially I think

224
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,429
it's Dylan Klebold who was the more literate of the two but he tells you

225
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:26,828
exactly where he went after brooding and brooding and brooding on his his

226
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:31,958
isolation and segregation from mankind so he's out there beyond he's out there

227
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,859
in a chaotic domain and because he's tortured by that his thoughts take an

228
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,079
unbelievably dark turn like it's unimaginably dark if you're interested

229
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,509
in that sort of thing you could read that there's another book you could read

230
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:50,078
called panzram PA and Zed ra m and it's a fascinating book it's about this guy

231
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,309
who I think he raped 1200 men so that sort of tells you what sort of guy he

232
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:59,500
was extraordinarily physically powerful and brutal and malevolent and he was

233
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,250
kind of a juvenile delinquent type and they put him in a reform school and he

234
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,179
was not well treated in that reform school it's sort of like the worst of

235
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,769
the Canadian residential schools and when he came out he was not a happy boy

236
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:16,509
and so he spent the rest of his life trying to be as destructive as he could

237
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:23,199
possibly imagine and purely consciously with malevolent intent and then and and

238
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,589
believe me he was pretty destructive he kept track of the dollar value of all

239
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,619
the buildings he burned down he tried to start a war between Britain and the

240
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:35,049
United States like he was all out for all-out mayhem his dying words they're

241
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,970
gonna hang him he told the guy who was going to hang him he said hurry up you

242
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,720
who's your bastard I could kill 12 men in the time it takes you to hang me and

243
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,220
that's exactly the sort of person he was and he made friends with this physician

244
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,750
in the in the prison who he thought was like the first person who ever did

245
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,140
something nice for him gave him a dollar for cigarettes if I remember correctly

246
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,040
and the physician encouraged him to write his autobiography and so he did

247
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:05,079
and it's it's available and so if you want a view because you know you you

248
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,829
always think of people you think well people have good intentions you know

249
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:12,970
that you especially think that if you're naive and agreeable so all of you who

250
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,940
are sitting there out there thinking people have good intentions you're

251
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,259
probably high in agreeableness but that's not always the case

252
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:25,029
people can have very dark motivations that are fully conscious and very well

253
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:30,129
elaborated and panzram was know he was smart and his book is very well written

254
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,300
and he tells you exactly why he thought the way he thought and so it's a good

255
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,319
glimpse of exactly this sort of thing where you can get to if you want to by

256
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,179
brooding on your specific misfortune you know and his his basic credo was that

257
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,180
human beings were so reprehensible that they should just be eliminated and

258
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,500
believe me that's what he was trying to do and these people who do terrible

259
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,369
things like the Columbine shooters that's exactly what for black of a

260
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,869
better word they're possessed by its sheer malevolence and the Columbine kids

261
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,529
had a much more spectacular catastrophe planned than the one that actually

262
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:07,059
occurred and they knew it was going to be a full-blown media circus and lots of

263
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,019
these people who engage in those sorts of mass murders they know about the

264
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,769
other mass murders and they're engaged in a competition and the competition is

265
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:19,089
who can do the most brutal thing the fastest something like that so you can't

266
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:23,439
just be thinking about people who've you know who have good intentions but have

267
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,279
somehow gone wrong if you ever meet someone who isn't like that and you

268
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,529
think that you're just a tree with ripe fruit to be plucked so you don't want to

269
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,609
be in that situation you have to keep your eyes open and so anyways that's

270
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,179
basically what's encapsulated in this part of the story now the hyenas go

271
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,380
after the little lion obviously but they managed to escape

272
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,890
it's very malevolent scene and Mufasa shows up at the last minute to rescue

273
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:56,140
them so and you know that there's also a mythological trope there which is that

274
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,860
if you go outside your domain of confidence and you encounter something

275
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,129
you don't understand the first thing that you're going to do is look to the

276
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,820
knowledge structures that you already possess to explain it right and that's

277
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,029
the you could say from a symbolic perspective that that's the

278
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:14,559
manifestation of the father as of course that's what you're going to do and you

279
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,618
you know what's really interesting - is because I've had a lot of clients

280
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:21,908
who've had PTSD and and without exception every single one of them was

281
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:25,989
induced by one form of malevolence or another they have to develop a very

282
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,950
sophisticated philosophy of good and evil to get out of it because they have

283
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,278
a worldview in which those things don't really exist there's no such thing as

284
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:37,898
pure malevolence well that's fine unless you encounter it and then as soon as you

285
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:42,848
encounter it as soon as you encounter it you won't know what to do and then you

286
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,749
won't be able to get on with your life you'll do nothing but think about that

287
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:49,588
and think about it and think about it and think about it'll disrupt your sleep

288
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:54,548
it'll put you into a permanent state of preparation for action because the part

289
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:58,298
of your brain that's detected that which in my estimation by the way is the same

290
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:03,069
part at least in part that detects snakes it's the same damn circuit once

291
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:06,578
it's seen something like that it is not gonna let you go till you figure it out

292
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:10,808
and that's basically what post-traumatic stress disorder is and you know to some

293
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:15,489
degree each of you will have experienced that maybe not all of you in here but

294
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:19,569
many of you and you can tell that so if you go back and you think about your

295
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:24,368
past and you have any memory that's more than about eighteen months old and when

296
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:29,199
you think about it it produces a fair bit of negative emotion then that's like

297
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,979
a minute that's like a place where there's a mini post-traumatic stress

298
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:37,328
problem and what's happened you remember I showed you that hierarchy moving from

299
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,288
tiny motor actions all the way up to high order abstractions well you can

300
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:45,959
imagine say you have good person at the top and and you you kind of use that

301
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:51,489
that scenario to construe other people people are basically good well then you

302
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:55,838
run into someone who is not good and boom the whole bloody system comes

303
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:58,989
tumbling down because it's violated that highest order axiom

304
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:03,219
so that's post-traumatic stress disorder if something has violated an axiom

305
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:07,599
that's more differentiated you know closer to the actual motor output not

306
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:11,739
quite so high in the abstraction chain then all it does is wipe out that part

307
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:15,069
of the structure it doesn't wipe out the whole thing and you can tell if you have

308
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:21,578
holes in your perceptual value structure by checking to see if you have memories

309
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:25,719
that are still alive in a negative way that are old enough so that they should

310
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,288
have been incorporated into your personality and so one of the things you

311
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:33,429
can do you're doing one of the exercises that's

312
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,419
on myself authoring site you guys do the personality analysis but there's another

313
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,288
program there called the that's called the past authoring where you write down

314
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:46,269
an autobiography and thinking through these things that have happened to you

315
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:50,288
in your past that are negative is a good way of making them go away and thinking

316
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:55,388
them through kind of means you have to figure out what happened right and then

317
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:58,418
you sort of have to figure out how to make it not happen again what you're

318
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,009
trying to derive is some kind of causal analysis how is it that I was put into a

319
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:07,269
situation where I was made vulnerable you know and that could be well because

320
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,000
you're only four and you couldn't protect yourself and now it's time to

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,169
update that because you're a fully functioning adult or there may be things

322
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,379
that you have to think through and change in your own personality or

323
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:21,730
attitudes that you've been holding on to since you were tiny I have this client

324
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,308
once and she came in and told me that she had been sexually assaulted by her

325
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:31,148
older brother and she told me the story and I kind of got the impression that

326
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:35,469
maybe she was like eight and he was like 17 or something like that and she was

327
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,069
about 27 when she came and talked to me and then I found out by further

328
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:44,619
questioning that she was 4 and he was 6 and I thought she still had this story

329
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,878
in her head of her being tormented by this older person right that's how she

330
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,230
told the story and what I told her was well look another way of looking at this

331
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,878
is that you two were very badly supervised children because I mean he

332
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:01,480
was 6 for God's sake you know he's a little kid that doesn't mean that what

333
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,329
happened to her was any less traumatic but but he wasn't 17 right if the story

334
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:11,259
was different than the one she had in her head and you know by the time she

335
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,798
left after we had that conversation it was clear that the way that she was

336
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,429
construing the experience had radically shifted and it was very interesting

337
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:23,288
because you know you think of the past as fixed but and it is in some sense but

338
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:28,058
the reason you remember the past isn't to make an objectively accurate record

339
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:32,980
of the past it's so that you can use the information in the past to prepare you

340
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,419
for the future and your mind won't leave you alone unless that has happened so if

341
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,500
you've encountered something that's negative and you don't know why and you

342
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,660
don't know what to do about it if that have

343
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,769
again in the future then that will stay with you and I think one of the things

344
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,849
that does too is it increases your overall physiological load is actually

345
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:56,230
physiologists who've been talking about this I can't remember the damn phrase

346
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,319
but you could imagine that your mind is doing something like this all the time

347
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,990
it's it's it's it's got a record in some sense of your autobiographical

348
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,099
experiences and what it's doing is calculating how frequently you've been

349
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:13,329
successful versus unsuccessful and the more frequently that you've been

350
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,990
successful the higher you are up on the dominance hierarchy that's one

351
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,120
possibility so your serotonin levels go up and you're calmer but also it's

352
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,329
reasonable to assume that the environment is less dangerous right

353
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:30,250
because that's sort of what constitutes danger you're somewhere in and you act

354
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,630
and and something you don't want to have happen happens that's danger and so your

355
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,870
brain is always trying to figure out how to calibrate how anxious you should be

356
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,289
and one of the things that does is by sort of keeping track of your past

357
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:47,440
success failure ratio and so to the degree that your past has been

358
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,039
characterized by will call them failures that those are situations where you do

359
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,779
not get what you want then your your body your brain puts your body on

360
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:59,829
constant alert because if everything that you've done has resulted in

361
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,529
catastrophe then you're somewhere insanely dangerous

362
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:07,329
and you should be like like a you know like a prey animal that's ready to dart

363
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:12,730
in any direction and how much you should be a prey animal is dependent on it's an

364
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,250
estimate partly your trait neuroticism partly your your success as adjudicated

365
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,390
by other people right because they'll pop you up the doorman its hierarchy if

366
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,380
you've been successful but also partly on your record of failures and successes

367
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,090
in the past and so you can go back and you can find out where you have holes in

368
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,809
your in the structure through which you're viewing the world that's one way

369
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:38,980
of looking at it and you can sew those things up and that's a very that's in

370
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,160
some sense that's what you're doing in psychotherapy you know partly it's

371
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,000
exposure to things you're afraid of and disgusted by and are likely to avoid

372
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,380
that's a huge chunk of it but if you go back into your past and you start

373
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,210
talking those things through it's really the same thing it's more abstracted so

374
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,340
Freud of course was always when he was doing his free association

375
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:05,419
process with his clients he'd find that if he just let them talk that their

376
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,400
speech would circle until it hit a place like that where they were confused and

377
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,360
doubtful and then their speech would sort of wander around that and and then

378
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,929
they'd have an emotional expression that was a consequence of that he thought the

379
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,830
emotional expression was what was curative it was cathartic in his terms

380
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:27,859
but later James Pennebaker upon whom these writing exercises I described his

381
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:33,529
research it is based on that my read my exercises are based on his research he

382
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,399
found that if you brought college students into the to the lab and you had

383
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,960
them write for 15 minutes three times over three days about the worst thing

384
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,230
that had ever happened to them or the worst thing they ever did if I remember

385
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,039
correctly they got worse in the short term but better in the long run for

386
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,639
example they went visited the doctor less and markers of their physical

387
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,009
health improved and so I think the reason for that is because what does

388
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,359
that called is called something load just about it got it right from the

389
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,429
physiologist it doesn't matter they got healthier as far as I can tell

390
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,840
because they basically calmed down once they had gone through the negative

391
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,549
memory and sorted it out properly and told a properly articulated story and

392
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:23,329
figured out how to deal with it then their physiology calmed down and so then

393
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:26,899
they weren't as stressed they weren't producing as much cortisol and so

394
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,290
cortisol suppresses your immune function and so they were more likely to stay

395
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:36,109
healthy and so well so that's all very much we're thinking about that's all in

396
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,740
the domain outside of the light that's one way of thinking about it now of

397
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,490
course Simba and his and what's the girl's name

398
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,380
mala yeah they're you know pretty cowed about what has happened because they

399
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,450
sort of stumbled stupidly out into the unknown they stumbled foolishly out into

400
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,710
the unknown and this actually highlights another union archetype and that's the

401
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,069
archetype of the trickster and the trickster is like the Joker in the

402
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:05,629
king's court and the trickster is someone who will be or play the fool and

403
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,410
the thing about the fool is that the fool is close to the truth because you

404
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,480
can't learn anything new unless you're willing to be

405
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,950
fool right you know what that's like you you know exactly what that's like your

406
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,850
chart you have to master a new skill but you're avoiding it because you know that

407
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:23,329
you'll be bad at it when you first do it and if you're perfectionistic you're

408
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:27,259
gonna say well I can't allow myself to be bad at anything I can't allow myself

409
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:31,369
to be a fool and no wonder but the problem is is when you try something new

410
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:35,119
you're always a fool and so unless you're willing to be a fool you can't

411
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,599
learn anything new and that's also why you can regarded the trickster as the

412
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,769
precursor to the Savior architect Lee speaking is because you cannot do the

413
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:46,940
right thing unless you're willing to be a fool first and that's really worth

414
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,320
knowing lots of times you guys are gonna make a stage transition in your life and

415
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:54,769
you're gonna feel like an imposter when you get a new job or when you get a

416
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,430
promotion or something like that you're gonna feel like an imposter and you are

417
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,049
because what do you know when you make that first transition right but it's

418
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:06,799
gonna make you embarrassed and it's gonna make you ashamed and all of those

419
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,339
things but you have to understand that you are a fool when you first try

420
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:14,539
something new but you're a worse fool if you don't try it now that doesn't mean

421
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:18,259
you should you know make like you know everything as soon as you're promoted or

422
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:23,329
you have some transition in status that's that's foolish of the wrong sort

423
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:29,419
but to know that to know that you have to be fallible in order to progress is

424
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,650
an unbelievably useful thing it can free you up you know what I was talking to a

425
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,820
writer the other day about his process for beginning writing he's written many

426
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:43,429
books he writes a very very very bad first draft right and that's a good way

427
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,250
to think about things is throughout your life you're gonna be doing that is

428
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:52,069
writing the next draft of you and it's pretty bad to begin with but that's okay

429
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,879
because it isn't gonna get any better unless you put yourself out into the

430
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,630
domain of the unknown to begin with and you know you might you might it might go

431
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,460
badly I mean that's what happens here

432
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,849
anyways Mufasa has a chat with Simba and you know tells him that he's he did what

433
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:16,599
he wasn't supposed to do although you know even in that situation with fauces

434
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,409
discipline is paradoxical because there's part of him because he's

435
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,500
reasonably wise that knows that breaking the rules like that is actually

436
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,349
necessary even though you still have to say play

437
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:30,918
by the damn rules you know you have to leave that door open so that the rules

438
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,870
can be broken an appropriate amount so he forgives him and and and peace is

439
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:41,329
made between them and then they're there they involve themselves in sort of

440
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:45,048
gazing at the night sky and so the two of them do that together and the night

441
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,408
sky is an interesting place you know because that's where the absolute

442
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:53,960
unknown resides and one of the things young wrote a lot about was astrology

443
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,759
strangely enough slash astronomy and one of young contentions this is a very

444
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,870
interesting one was that because the night sky was completely unknown people

445
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:06,548
could project their fantasies into it and that's what they did without with

446
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:11,628
astrology so astrology is this cumulative fantasy that's going on in

447
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:16,099
the in that roughly speaking in the deep unconscious projected on to the sky and

448
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:20,689
so if you analyze old astrological writings what you're really doing is

449
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,440
analyzing old fantasies and because of that you could develop some insight into

450
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,610
the structure of the mind and so he did the same thing with alchemy and his

451
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,089
later writings which are very very difficult to understand but extremely

452
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:37,668
worthwhile ok so anyways back to the to the hellish domain now I told you that

453
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,970
that domain that's outside of knowledge you could think about that as the

454
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,360
underworld or you can think about it as nature the negative element of nature in

455
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,859
particular and so I mentioned that one element of that is hellish and that's

456
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:53,449
exactly what the movie explains next it does exactly that we go back out to this

457
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,399
domain that scar the adversary or the negative king that's another way of

458
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:05,479
looking at him this is his his the domain over which he rules and so you

459
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,589
can see him there surrounded in fire same ideas the you know as the hyenas

460
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:13,069
surrounded by fire earlier although this is green fire and smoke which I think is

461
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:19,418
even worse and this is where the movie starts to draw on essentially Nazi

462
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:24,110
symbolism at least the symbolism of totalitarian states and you know you

463
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:27,469
think about you think about a totalitarian state you think about the

464
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,980
Nazis and they're goose-stepping what's happening is that every single

465
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,389
person in the military becomes an identical unit right a unit they're all

466
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,199
uniform and they're all in some sense imitating

467
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,778
The Dictator in in an absolutely perfect way and so the dictator wants to impose

468
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:50,569
strict uniformity on the entire population that's order order and one of

469
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:56,178
the things we've discovered that's really interesting is that discussed

470
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:00,710
sensitivity is associated with orderliness and that's associated with

471
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,798
conscientiousness and one of the things about Hitler was that he was very

472
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:09,019
disgust sensitive and a lot of his hatred for non-aryans so imagine inside

473
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:13,099
the aryan box it was all uniform outside it was all parasites and predators and

474
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,899
so and that was a manifestation of disgust not of fear it's a whole

475
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:20,989
different thing and if you read Hitler's table talk

476
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:26,568
which is a collection of his spontaneous dinner speeches from 1939 to 1940 - it's

477
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:32,389
a very interesting book you see that his metaphor for the Aryan race was a body a

478
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,139
pure body unof salted by parasites or predators

479
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,099
and that he was trying to erect a border around it to keep all of that away

480
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:45,260
so it's an immunological disgust like metaphor and there's some recent work

481
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,000
that was published in PLoS ONE about three years ago showing that brilliant

482
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,909
study should have got much more attention showing that if you went

483
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,349
around and looked and sampled political attitudes in different countries or even

484
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,150
within the same country what you found was that the higher the prevalence of

485
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,769
infectious diseases the higher the probability of totalitarian political

486
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:11,179
attitudes at the local level and you can imagine well what happens if there's

487
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,480
infectious diseases is you want to put borders around everything you don't want

488
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,108
free movement between ideas or people because that's partly how the disease

489
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:23,838
spreads you're going to have much more strict sexual rules for example because

490
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,710
that's a great way for diseases to be transmitted and before Hitler went on

491
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,778
his rampage against the non-aryans he'd cleaned up all the factories and like he

492
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:36,469
went in there and fumigated them it was part of the law he went on a public

493
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,858
health campaign to get rid of tuberculosis and he got rid of the bugs

494
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:45,078
in the factories as well he used cyclone B that's an insecticide and that's the

495
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,740
gas that he used in the gas chambers eventually so first it was the bugs in

496
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,789
the rats and then it was people who were then it was euthanasia that was the neck

497
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,789
move and forced you euthanasia and the the rationale for that was compassion by

498
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:03,889
the way just so you all know it's it's it's merciful to put these people who

499
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:08,409
are burdensome to themselves and their families and the state who are living

500
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:13,609
second-rate lives its merciful to euthanize them and that was a huge

501
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:20,269
campaign in Germany it was after that that the more racial purifications began

502
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:26,530
and so that's the disgust thing that's unbelievably important it's it's it's

503
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,740
because lots of times people think that conservatives are more anxiety sensitive

504
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:34,519
than liberals and that's why they're closed in terms of their ideas that

505
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,800
doesn't look right first of all conservatives are less

506
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,580
neurotic than liberals although the effect isn't that big so it doesn't look

507
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,389
and they actually are there they score higher in measures of well-being the

508
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:51,049
most unhappy people are liberal men by the way so but you know people are often

509
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,560
accused if they're conservative of being fearful and that's why they you know

510
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,679
suppress other people's viewpoints but that doesn't look right it's low

511
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,819
openness and high orderliness and that looks like it's associated with disgust

512
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,780
and that looks like it's associated with something called the extended immune

513
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,500
system which is the proclivity of people to to keep themselves away from

514
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,699
potential sources of contamination it's really terrifying because one of the

515
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,359
things people often said about Germany was that you know it was a very

516
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,720
civilized country and yet it descended into barbarity

517
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,059
but conscientiousness is a very good predictor of long-term success and so

518
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,500
you could say well conscientious societies are more civilized but they're

519
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,980
also more orderly and that makes them more discussed sensitive and so what it

520
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,210
might have easily might have easily been in Germany was that it was an excess of

521
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,860
civilization rather than its lack that produced exactly these consequences and

522
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,980
that's a far more frightening proposition and one that's I believe

523
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,050
much more likely to be true Hitler bathed four times a day and he was also

524
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,590
an admirer of willpower so he could stand like this for eight hours in the

525
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,590
back of a car and the thing about conscientious people is they're very

526
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,410
willpower oriented and so if you're unfortunate enough to be sick

527
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:06,199
chronically in the house of someone who's conscientious

528
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,588
if it's a mental illness you're more likely to relapse because the

529
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:12,320
conscientious person is going to be judgmental and they're going to say to

530
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,050
you if you're schizophrenic they're going to say well if you just organize

531
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,720
yourself and get up in the morning and try a little harder

532
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,069
you could overcome this which is of course true except you can't because

533
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,150
you're schizophrenic and so the pressure put on you by the anger and the contempt

534
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,980
is going to increase the probability that you'll relapse so orderly people

535
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,210
are very judgmental and you know orderliness is very highly associated

536
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,619
with things like anorexia and the anorexic is basically someone who's so

537
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:44,119
disgust sensitive that they become unable to tolerate their own body and

538
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,079
they see it as a source of corruption and imperfection which of course is

539
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,410
exactly right it is and it's very difficult thing to maintain order around

540
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:59,809
so anyways so what happens out here in this terrible domain where scar rules is

541
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:04,429
that things turn into a totalitarian state you know and he's presented here

542
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:09,199
as as a Nazi like leader and see there's another thing that's really interesting

543
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,368
this even deeper than this from a mythological perspective I don't know if

544
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,380
I can even go into it well not really I guess what I'll have to do is satisfy

545
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,990
myself with this observation there's always been some antagonism for example

546
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:27,949
between the Catholic Church and rationalism and everyone knows that it's

547
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:32,719
a very long-standing antagonism that sort of runs its way through at least

548
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,669
the last thousand years or so of Western civilization and the people who regarded

549
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,730
kaathal catholics as antithetical to science

550
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:45,650
take the Catholics to task for that and describing it as prejudicial and super

551
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,190
and superstitious and fair enough but there's something else going on

552
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,030
there that's more important and that's the observation and this is at a deep

553
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:59,660
level again the observation that rationality has one big problem so it's

554
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:04,460
it can easily become arrogant and believe in its own theories so if you're

555
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,608
smart and there's gonna be some of you people who are like that to some of you

556
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:12,049
your primary the primary trait that distinguishes you from other people over

557
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,530
the course of your whole life was that you are more intelligent than most and

558
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,059
you may have staked your identity on that and an over value

559
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,689
and rationality and the problem with that is that you you make a theory of

560
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:27,949
the world and then you tend to assume that it's 100% correct that's the

561
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:31,400
tendency to fall in love with your own theories and that's what a totalitarian

562
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,588
does the totalitarian says here's the damn theory and it's exactly right and

563
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:41,719
you're gonna act it out exactly and if you don't well we've got some special

564
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,679
treats in mind for you and one of the most terrible things that that I

565
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,038
encountered while reading about totalitarianism and this was even more

566
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,799
true of the Soviet Union under Stalin was that the true believers and and

567
00:40:54,798 --> 00:41:00,108
there were many of them we're in a terrible position because according to

568
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,409
their own doctrine they're already involved in the process that was going

569
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:07,399
to bring utopia to mankind the problems had already been solved but many of them

570
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,660
were still suffering terribly as individuals but if you're a totalitarian

571
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:16,518
believer in Utopia your own suffering becomes heretical right because your

572
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:20,478
suffering is an indication that the damn theory isn't correct and so then you're

573
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,478
in a terrible position because you either admit that the theory isn't

574
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:27,919
correct and fall apart because of that and maybe face terrible punishment as

575
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,588
well or you have to separate yourself from your own suffering and lie about it

576
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,558
fundamentally and of course that's exactly what happened in places like the

577
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,910
Soviet Union where everyone lied about everything all of the time to themselves

578
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:46,219
to their family members to their friends the entire system was completely

579
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:53,599
permeated by lies and so you get this terrible place that scars the ruler over

580
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,369
which is totalitarian and brutal and murderous and resentful and deceitful

581
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:07,670
and arrogant all at the same time and that's brought about so mmm-hmm the

582
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,778
columbine guys for example when they're justifying their murderous nests and

583
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:17,449
their plans to shoot up the schools they keep making reference to the fact that

584
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:22,309
people had slighted them for example you know and insulted them and that they

585
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,910
were alienated they weren't bullied exactly the way the press made it out I

586
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:28,670
don't know if they were bullied anymore than people usually are in high school

587
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,740
but they took their alienation personally and we

588
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,959
guarded that their isolation from common humanity as indication of the pathology

589
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,460
of everything and then they went out to destroy and that's exactly what this

590
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,150
sort of thing represents that's the uniformity and you see he's got this

591
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,789
kind of vicious grin on his face which is malicious and and pleased all at the

592
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:57,400
same time there's no fear in that it'sit's quite quite the opposite and

593
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,970
there's another image of you know using what's essentially imagery of Hell which

594
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:06,049
everyone understands strangely enough and that associates him with the

595
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,280
crescent moon and the crescent moon is well it's a symbol of darkness and and

596
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,730
the underworld fundamentally so all right so anyway so that's we see the the

597
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,119
underworld we see that which bullet lies beyond the light and in there we see a

598
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,329
fragment of that that's basically hellish and all of that's incorporated

599
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:28,009
into the story and everyone understands that when they see it even without I

600
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,530
would say the overt references to Nazism okay so now scar has a plan he's going

601
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:39,410
to kill the king and he's going to do that by putting what the King loves in

602
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:47,949
danger and so scar feigning sympathy has enticed Simba down into this ravine and

603
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:53,899
scars minions are going to cause a wildebeest stampede right so a mindless

604
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:01,780
stampede to to to put to put Simba in danger and so that's what happens here

605
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:09,260
the Whale debate start to march into the ravine and everyone is making a scar

606
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,900
tells Mufasa that Simba is down in that ravine and entices him down there and so

607
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:22,010
they're all off running to see if they can save Simba and then you see Mufasa

608
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,000
running in front of the wildebeest herd trying to try to find his son and trying

609
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,750
to stay ahead of them the mad mob that's put his son in danger and so he tries to

610
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,460
escape climbing up the Butte which is almost a sheer cliff and when it gets to

611
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,608
the top mmm his brother is waiting for him there and he asks him to pull him up

612
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:49,369
and scar basically before he indicates that he's betraying him and

613
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:56,059
puts his claws into Moo fusses paws and throws him off the cliff and so that's

614
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,840
that and it's a sad part of the story it's a hard part that's very hard on

615
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,400
kids because the father has died and you know it's a rare kid who won't cry about

616
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,230
that scene in particular where you see Simba very upset and his father dying

617
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,849
now this is a hard part of the story to interpret and I don't know if it's

618
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:16,849
because of my lack of ability to interpret her because the story takes a

619
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:21,829
weird twist here but there-there is this confusion in the story about whether

620
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:26,750
Simba is an innocent victim who set up for the murder of his father or whether

621
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,369
he actually bears some guilt for it you know and he's broken some rules and and

622
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:36,559
that and and so on so he's not exactly placed in the position of innocence but

623
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,730
of course he's also been set up by scar in any case scar tells him that it's his

624
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,990
fault pure and pure and that because of that he's going to have to leave he's

625
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:54,729
gonna have to be banished beyond the kingdom now you see this motif quite

626
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,920
quite frequently in heroes stories where the hero has to be raised outside of the

627
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,110
kingdom that happens with King Arthur for example and it happens with Harry

628
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,260
Potter right because Harry Potter is raised by muggles instead of being

629
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,000
inside the Magic Kingdom so it's a very common theme and partly what it means is

630
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,889
that it means two things one is that you do grow up alienated from your culture

631
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:22,549
to some degree there's no way around that because the culture doesn't match

632
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,170
you perfectly and it doesn't work for you perfectly and it's old and it's kind

633
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,220
of corrupt and it alienates you as it's shaping you and so you're going to

634
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:36,589
develop some separation from it and you see that in intergenerational rhetoric

635
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,710
you know we're the new generation has the proclivity to blame the previous

636
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,849
generation for everything that's wrong with the current system and fair enough

637
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:47,839
you know because you do inherit everything that's wrong of course you

638
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,110
also inherit everything that's going well which is a good thing to also

639
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:57,170
notice but the idea is that you can't help but be alienated from let's call it

640
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,220
the patriarchy for for lack of a better word because it's got a tyrannical

641
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:06,169
element and because it's not matched well to you so but then there's also

642
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:12,500
this other issue which is well maybe you're not being successful by the terms

643
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,309
that are by the values that are instantiated in the current system and

644
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:20,359
you might say well that's because the system is set up in an unfair manner and

645
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:24,318
fair enough but it's also possibly because you're just not very good at

646
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,279
acting out those values right so part of the reason you get alienated from your

647
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,640
culture is because the culture is corrupt but another part of the reason

648
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:36,440
is you're just not doing as well as you could be you're not playing by the rules

649
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,700
properly and so you get alienated and you're unsuccessful because of your own

650
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:46,699
inadequacies and so the movie plays both of those it's obviously Simba is set up

651
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:52,368
but there is an intimation that he's not entirely blameless as well anyways he's

652
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,990
very broken up about this and no wonder it's also partly a story of the

653
00:47:56,989 --> 00:48:01,038
emergence of adolescence because you know when you're a child and you're

654
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,930
ensconced right inside the familial framework then you sort of exist within

655
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:10,009
that system of rules like you would under the piagetian scheme but when you

656
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,420
become an adolescent then there's much more of a proclivity to break free and

657
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,490
to start breaking rules and so that's also akin in some sense to the death of

658
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:26,149
the father and that's a necessary developmental stage anyway scar comes

659
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,960
down into the ravine it's all foggy now because that goes along with the sort of

660
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,809
murkiness of death and tells Simba that it's his fault and that he's going to

661
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:40,160
have to leave he's going to have to leave the kingdom of his father which

662
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,358
makes sense now his father's dead so how are you gonna once your father has died

663
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:49,699
how are you going to stay around in his kingdom so to speak so and then scar

664
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:58,189
tries to get these hyenas to go track Simba down and kill him so and Zazu goes

665
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,510
back to tell all the rest of the Lions that Mufasa is dead and that Simba has

666
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:09,920
disappeared and then scar takes over Pride Rock and so what's happened now is

667
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,809
the malevolent element of the King has obtained control over

668
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:21,099
state right and so this is the king the wise King wasn't paying enough attention

669
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,549
that's one way of looking at it and so the malevolent part of the state has now

670
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:31,039
got control this is a very very old idea I've traced it back at least several

671
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,300
thousand years in its in its representation in stories you can see it

672
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,680
in Egyptian mythology for example so the idea is that as the social structure

673
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,849
builds in complexity it offers you the protection of a functioning complex

674
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:48,440
system but it also becomes increasingly likely to turn into a tyranny and

675
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,950
because it's more and more powerful the fact of its potential for tyranny

676
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:57,049
becomes more and more of a danger and so then the question is well what are the

677
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:02,420
factors that encourages it turning into a tyranny and one factor would be the

678
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,829
wise part of it is not paying enough attention to the malevolent part of it

679
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:10,519
and you could say that's true at the state level it's also true at the

680
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,809
individual level right you have to watch your own proclivity to upset yourself

681
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:19,489
and other people and and take that into account and pay careful attention to it

682
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,149
because otherwise it can gain control especially because you're gonna avoid

683
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,550
looking at it and one of the characteristics of the wise King who

684
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,240
gets overthrown by the tyrant is that he has an evil brother and he won't pay

685
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,699
enough attention to him he avoids he doesn't look and so the the evil King

686
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:41,269
gets the upper hand and that's what's happened here and so notice now he takes

687
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:47,750
possession of Pride Rock not in full daylight right but at night so that ties

688
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,719
his rule into the rule of unconscious processes and and malevolence

689
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:58,669
alright so Simba runs away from the kingdom out into the desert now why is

690
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,690
that well you remember maybe you remember and maybe you don't maybe don't

691
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,559
know it the story of Exodus when Moses takes the Hebrews out of Egypt they end

692
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,829
up in a desert well why well it's because when you leave Kingdom no matter

693
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:17,869
how ironical you still fall into disorder you're out in a place that's

694
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:23,029
desert there's no civilization there you know that's what happened to Iraq after

695
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,150
the Americans went in you know the the Americans the neo-cons were all

696
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,639
convinced that the Iraqis would Oh welcome

697
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,538
with open arms and there would be this smooth transition to democracy same idea

698
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:37,220
and Libya it's like no that's not what happens what happens is the state

699
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:43,338
devolves into a desert chaos and maybe then you can make order but probably not

700
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:47,599
and so Simba has left the kingdom and the first thing that happens is he damn

701
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,970
near dies in the desert and so you know if you have an old belief system and

702
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:56,959
it's not working very well and you abandon it well good for you because

703
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,858
you're out of the old belief system but now you're nowhere one of the things

704
00:52:00,858 --> 00:52:04,909
that happens to alcoholics for example and and draw a draw other drug addicts

705
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:12,558
as well so imagine that you're trying to stop drinking alright fine maybe you

706
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,039
have to undergo some medical treatment so when you first stop you don't die of

707
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:20,390
seizures because that often happens to people who are addicted to alcohol so

708
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:23,629
and then they get valium or something like that from a doctor to see them

709
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:31,338
through the first bits of what do you call it well of sobering-up and so they

710
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:35,058
get through it and then then maybe two weeks later they're not physiologically

711
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:40,910
dependent on alcohol anymore the same thing is true of cocaine but if

712
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:44,268
you take them back and you put them in their environment say they go back out

713
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:47,959
of the treatment center back into the normal world they start drinking or

714
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,170
using right away again and the reason for that is that well let's say you've

715
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:56,838
been an alcoholic for 20 years okay first of all that's all you do for

716
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:05,179
entertainment you drink and all your friends are alcoholics right and so if

717
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:17,989
you're gonna stop drinking not only do you have to rid yourself of the of the

718
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,639
physiological addiction but you have to completely learn a new way of living

719
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,068
because what do you know you have to get rid of all your friends because they're

720
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,159
all drunks pretty much or if they're not there at least people who are

721
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,759
facilitating your drinking so you have to build a whole new social network you

722
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:35,210
don't know how to amuse yourself because of course the way you've done that is by

723
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,659
going to the bar sitting at home drinking and so there's a huge hole in

724
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:42,339
your life you abandon the previous pathological mode

725
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:47,170
a patient but that just leaves you with nothing and then you have to rebuild

726
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,490
that thing from from from from scratch it's extraordinarily difficult and

727
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,769
that's why so many people fail when they're trying to overcome a major

728
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:59,469
addiction so alright so anyways Simba's out there in the desert he's

729
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:05,589
left his family and the comforts of home and he's he's discovered by these by

730
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:11,110
Pumbaa and who's a little rats named Tim Timon

731
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:16,599
yes he's a meerkat right which are very cool things and they discover him and

732
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,769
this is sort of his transition into adolescence and he he kind of finds and

733
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:25,269
this is I would say more typical of the male transition into adolescence because

734
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:28,900
females of course hit puberty so much younger the males who aren't very

735
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,090
attractive when they're young like and just starting to undergo puberty they're

736
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,170
not very attractive to females they tend to clump together in in gangs and and

737
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,840
and manage the transition over what could be seven years so and that's what

738
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,680
happens here is Simba joins this little gang of you know these guys are alright

739
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,539
but you know they're a little on the primordial side you might say you know

740
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:57,159
one of them is basically just a walking gastrointestinal tract and the other one

741
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:00,819
is he's not so bad but he's like you know a foot high really what good is he

742
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,080
and so he he's got some second-rate companions out here past the desert but

743
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:08,949
he enters he's out of childhood now and now he enters the adolescent world and

744
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,669
what happens here is that very quickly in the film he goes from being a little

745
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:16,960
cub to a full full adolescence and there's about a five minute transition

746
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,500
and so it's the next stage in his development and now he's out there in

747
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,219
this paradise which is kind of strange because adolescence really is no no

748
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:28,269
picnic but the idea here is that he really doesn't have any responsibilities

749
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:33,429
right none and that is one thing about adolescences and even the stage of life

750
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:37,539
that you guys are out is you have lots to do but you're not really responsible

751
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:41,529
for anyone other than yourself and so even though you might be quite burdened

752
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,910
with your current responsibilities it's nothing compared to what it will be like

753
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,420
when you you know you have responsibilities for four children for

754
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,869
example or for the people that are working for you or or whatever

755
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:58,659
so anyways out here it's a kind of of place as well and adolescence is like

756
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:03,940
that we've had high school students try to do the future authoring program you

757
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,030
know where they have to think three to five years down the road it's like

758
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:11,170
forget that they just can't do it and I've watched them and what happens is

759
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:14,710
you you immediately become aware of just how little high school students know

760
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,369
when they're like fifteen or sixteen three to five years forget it

761
00:56:18,369 --> 00:56:21,760
they don't have the world knowledge to project themselves out that far in the

762
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,109
future not even close and so we've built a high school version that helps them

763
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:29,108
design a better future three to six months down the road and even that's

764
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:32,619
really pushing it but you know adolescents are more impulsive and they

765
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:38,798
live more for the moment and there's some utility in that I mean being

766
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:41,619
impulsive and living for the moment is one of the things that gets you pregnant

767
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:45,338
as a teenager and that is certainly one way that the species has managed to

768
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:51,219
propagate itself and so positive emotion and impulsivity are very tightly linked

769
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:58,088
and so he's out there in this adolescent delusional fantasy that might be one way

770
00:56:58,088 --> 00:57:01,929
of thinking about it but more important he's out there where he's in a domain

771
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:07,358
now where the impulses of the moment basically take precedence and so and I

772
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:15,219
think they sing some song about yeah Hakuna Matata right which basically

773
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:18,639
means do whatever you do whatever you want and tomorrow will take care of

774
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,480
itself or something like that so it's very impulsive and lacks all

775
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,710
responsibilities one of the things that I would recommend to you if you want to

776
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,720
protect yourself from ideological possession shall we say is that when you

777
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,409
hear people speak politically and they don't say anything about your

778
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:39,789
responsibilities you should probably stop listening to them because whenever

779
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,058
they're trying to offer you something if it doesn't come along with an equivalent

780
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:47,470
cost there's something being hidden from you and they're appealing to the part of

781
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:52,629
you that's well I would say at best adolescent so alright so anyways he's

782
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:58,119
out there in his little adolescent paradise and with his dopey chums and

783
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:06,510
back at at Pride Rock things are not good right Skaar who's arrogant and

784
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,470
refuses to learn and who will not establish a reasonable relationship with

785
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:15,279
the females all he does is tyrannize over them he ends up ruling over a

786
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,390
completely barren landscape and that's really what happens in totalitarian

787
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:23,529
states and we also know quite interestingly is that one of the best

788
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:27,610
predictors of economic development in a state is the degree to which they extend

789
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:32,110
rights to women it's one of the best predictors and I would say well if

790
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,870
you're going to terrorize your own women you're gonna Tarin eyes everything

791
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:38,829
you're gonna Terran eyes ideas you're gonna Terran eyes structures like if you

792
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:43,529
have to enslave your own women you're you've del adapted a pretty damn

793
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:47,830
pathological view of the world and the probability that that narrow constrained

794
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:51,699
restricted viewpoint is going to pay off for you economically is extraordinarily

795
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:56,289
low so anyways Skaar it's like what happened in the Soviet Union no part of

796
00:58:56,289 --> 00:59:02,409
the reason it collapsed by 1989 is that it just could not move any farther it

797
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:07,000
was like this really complicated motor that was worn completely out that no one

798
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,510
had ever taken care of and it's just ground to a halt

799
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:16,180
it just stopped working because it because it didn't work and so if your

800
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:20,619
totalitarian and you won't update your system and adjust it then it wears out

801
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:25,869
and grinds to a halt and everything becomes unproductive no it's it's not

802
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:29,319
easy to figure out what makes a society productive because you might say well

803
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,700
it's Natural Resources or something like that first of all natural resources are

804
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:37,960
very often a curse to a country because they produce corruption they call that

805
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,780
the Dutch disease there's a reason for that

806
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,790
you can look it up but natural resources in and of themselves are by no means

807
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:49,539
sufficient to guarantee the well-being of a country Japan has virtually no

808
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:54,759
natural resources at all and it's really rich and one of the prime natural

809
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,890
resources actually seems maybe there's two one is honesty another is trust and

810
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:03,639
if you can set up a society where people are roughly honest which means they do

811
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,769
what they say they're going to do and where the default bargaining position on

812
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:12,880
both sides is trust then the probability that that culture will become wealthy is

813
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,329
very very high so and a functional legal system is also a natural resource of

814
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:23,679
tremendous tremendous value you know it's partly why people in China for

815
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,739
example wealthy people in China are dumping their money into the real estate

816
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:30,759
market in North America like mad because one of the things you do know if you buy

817
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,660
real estate in North America is you actually own it it's still gonna be

818
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:38,649
yours 20 years in the future 30 years in the future there's no doubt about that

819
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:42,730
and so that fact of ownership is embedded in the functioning legal system

820
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:47,588
and that's what gives those sorts of properties crazy value you know much to

821
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:53,828
the much to the problematic situation for all of you people who are at some

822
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:57,010
point most of you are gonna try to buy property in Toronto and that's really

823
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:01,809
going to be entertaining so now look the the other thing about scars he's got the

824
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,800
little bird locked up right that's the vision of the king well he doesn't want

825
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,500
to know anything he already knows everything so why does he need this

826
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,199
stupid bird flying around telling him what's going on

827
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:16,779
the last thing he wants to know is what's going on yeah Stalin I mean

828
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,160
God he gave that guy bad news or good news he was going to have you killed

829
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:25,779
it kept the bad news to a minimum and that's a real problem right because if

830
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,780
you torture people who bring you bad news then you're never going to learn

831
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,769
anything well you don't have to if you already know everything anyways and so

832
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:38,889
that's the situation here well his little minions the hyenas are getting

833
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:41,828
pretty unhappy because they haven't had anything to eat and the reason for that

834
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:47,109
is they've just stripped the landscape bare right I mean and I read at the

835
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:50,828
demise of the Soviet Union that something like 10 to 15 percent of the

836
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:55,269
entire land mass of the Soviet Union had been rendered permanently uninhabitable

837
01:01:55,269 --> 01:02:00,429
by industrial pollution so you know that I don't remember if that included

838
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:04,118
Chernobyl you know where that terrible nuclear accident took place but but

839
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,349
there were massive domains of devastation and in those countries that

840
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:14,619
you know will take hundreds of years to fix so anyways when scar rules everyone

841
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:17,980
starves that's a good way of thinking about it or everyone dies but that's

842
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,858
okay because that's really what he's after anyway so that works out quite

843
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:25,088
nicely now back out here in paradise I mean look at him how pathetic can you

844
01:02:25,088 --> 01:02:29,828
get look at the expression on that creatures face you know he's he selfs

845
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:34,450
he's sated like someone who's just eaten a gallon of ice cream and he's got this

846
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:37,230
pathetic

847
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:44,389
self-satisfied naive clueless unconscious grin on his face which the

848
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:47,358
animators did a very nice job of capturing like that's a complicated

849
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,529
expression and you just want to slap him and that's exactly what should happen

850
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,519
and that's exactly what does happen so anyways he's out there be an unconscious

851
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:00,019
dingbat well his society is degenerating and that's bloody well worth thinking

852
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:03,889
about because that's an archetypal trope right it's like things are sinking

853
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:07,670
around you the question is what are you doing about it you know are you just

854
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:11,539
staying in kind of a blithe unconsciousness because you can get your

855
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:15,230
next meal are you gonna wake up and do something about it well that's the call

856
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:20,420
of the self so now we go back to two Rafiki here and he knows what's going on

857
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,710
in the kingdom he's a symbol of the self and he also has some inkling that Simba

858
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:29,838
is still alive so so the son of the king is still alive

859
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:35,509
despite the fact that the land has become ruled by a tyrant and the son is

860
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:40,280
absent he's still around somehow and so in a union from the Union perspective

861
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,910
there isn't much distinction between the self and the and the and the child the

862
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:51,559
self is the sum total of all possibility and the child is possibility itself and

863
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:57,079
so so let's say you've become an adolescent you're all cynical right and

864
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:01,460
everything's falling apart around you which is the typical state of human

865
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,639
beings right because adolescents are cynical generally speaking and

866
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,150
everything's falling around falling apart around them generally speaking and

867
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:13,849
so what do you have to do in order to to do something about that well one is you

868
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:17,539
have to be drawn by the call of wisdom and the other part is that you have to

869
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:22,460
rediscover that part of yourself that's a childlike part that's associated with

870
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:26,809
the son and associated with that early you know the early exposure of Simba to

871
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:31,519
the son you have to find that again and then trust that some childlike

872
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,570
exploration and a bit of manifestation of faith might get you to the next place

873
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:40,250
and so that's what's happening here with a little you know the baboon and the

874
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,880
tree and the and the drawing so anyways he knows that Simba is alive now

875
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,588
and so he goes off to find him and meanwhile Simba and his dopey companions

876
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:52,818
are out hunting for bugs you know because he's a lion you know he

877
01:04:52,818 --> 01:04:56,958
should meet bugs for crying out loud but they're easy and so you see this scene

878
01:04:56,958 --> 01:05:01,879
where Pumbaa goes after this bug and then another lion shows up and chases

879
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,999
him so she's gonna kill him and eat him and ha see that's an interesting thing

880
01:05:07,998 --> 01:05:12,978
because one of the things that happens I suppose you could think about this one

881
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:16,968
of the things that happens in late adolescence is that the formation of

882
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:22,130
male gangs is often broken up by the proclivity of one or more members of

883
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,358
that gang to get involved in an individual romantic relationship and so

884
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:32,838
the idea that the female lion is the carnivore the female is the carnivore

885
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:38,418
that will devour the group is exactly right and so what a girl will do often

886
01:05:38,418 --> 01:05:43,728
if she's in relationship with you know somebody like a young man or an older

887
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:47,718
adolescent is she'll try to separate him from his dopey friends and like no

888
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:51,409
wonder you know why wouldn't she do that because he does have dopey friends and

889
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:55,579
it'd be better for him if he could get beyond them and so anyways they're

890
01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:00,109
pretty freaked out about this and so then Simba goes out and has a fight with

891
01:06:00,108 --> 01:06:04,518
this lion to protect his dopey chums and I'm sure you don't need any explanation

892
01:06:04,518 --> 01:06:10,578
about what that means and they have this huge fight and neljä who it turns out to

893
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:15,048
be pins him and so that goes back to the beginning of the story where when he

894
01:06:15,048 --> 01:06:19,639
first encountered her she pinned him all the time she's an animal figure right

895
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:25,219
and now what she does immediately is shame him so she he's an atom a figure

896
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:28,489
in part she's an animal figure in part because she actually does shame him

897
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:32,389
right so she's the gateway to higher consciousness she makes him

898
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:37,728
self-conscious and rightly so but he's also a she's also a psychological figure

899
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:41,298
because he imagined that when a young man is establishing a relationship with

900
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:46,188
a young woman and he's he's enamored of her he's falling in love he projects an

901
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:49,818
idea onto her and that ideal is going to be partially fulfilled by the

902
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:53,748
relationship the degree to which is unspecified and sometimes it'll collapse

903
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:57,828
completely but he projects an ideal on to her because otherwise he wouldn't be

904
01:06:57,829 --> 01:07:01,880
attracted to her and then the ideal judges him and so that makes him feel

905
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,720
all self-conscious and and useful which is useful because he is useless

906
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:12,059
and should feel that way and so it's part of the impetus to growing up so and

907
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:18,509
of course one of the you need necessity in order to mature you because to mature

908
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:23,900
is to take on responsibility and you're not going to feel that impetus unless

909
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:28,829
adopting the responsibility has some sort of payoff and women tend to mate

910
01:07:28,829 --> 01:07:32,699
across an up dominance hierarchy so they tend to actually like men who are useful

911
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:37,739
and so if they encounter a man who isn't useful at all they're gonna that's

912
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:42,329
exactly what's going to happen they're gonna not be happy about that in the

913
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:47,250
least and so and no wonder and I think the reason for that it's an economic and

914
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:51,599
a biological reason the reason is is that women are in the position of having

915
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,449
to take care of infants primarily and an infant is a very heavy load and so even

916
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:01,679
a woman who's extraordinarily competent is going to find herself substantially

917
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,699
limited in her possibilities if she has an infant and so then she's looking

918
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:08,819
around for someone who'll pick up part of the load it's perfectly reasonable

919
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,769
and you're not gonna pick up part of the load if you're completely useless and so

920
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:19,289
it's in the woman's best interest not to have two children roughly speaking so

921
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:23,399
anyway she pins him and then he's all resentful about it immediately because

922
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,920
she's calling him on his stupid friends and the fact that he's out there

923
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,670
gallivanting impulsively in paradise when there's real problems to be solved

924
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:34,710
and so look at him he's all resentful and useless and and you know feeling put

925
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,460
upon and picked upon and you just you got to slap him again fundamentally and

926
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,319
she's just completely stunned by that it's like and tells them you know

927
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,729
where's the sim buy used to know right well he's a little doubtful about the

928
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:52,679
whole situation there the animators do a very nice job of this part of the movie

929
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,500
because one of the things you see is that his eyebrows are always pointing up

930
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,890
in the middle whereas his father's eyebrows were pointing down in the

931
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,680
middle and so that's the difference between this which is sort of like

932
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,700
things are happening to me and this which is more like I'm imposing my will

933
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:10,139
on things and that's an immature face and and the animators capture that

934
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:15,030
brilliantly so here's where she shames him again she tells him how much she

935
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:18,519
liked him when he was little and you know a potential king and

936
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:25,359
how hurt she is that he's this useless you know wide-eyed naive impulsive

937
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:32,200
pleasure-seeking adolescent and she tells him that she missed him and god

938
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:37,809
only knows why because look at him again it's like completely appalling palling

939
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:43,690
creature and this is when Pumbaa and Timon sing that song about the fact that

940
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:48,818
you know their friends doomed because you know this girl's got him and and

941
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:52,600
then they switch into another archetypal scene and so they're falling in love

942
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,490
here and so the paradisal imagery is really highlighted in the movie and so

943
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:02,559
they go off and have this like romp self-reflective romp through this new

944
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:11,530
paradise and they wrestle around and and play and then he pins her more or less

945
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:16,529
and she licks him that's that's not so good

946
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:22,059
and this is one of the most brilliant shots I think that the animators manage

947
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:26,980
because she's obviously pushing this a little bit farther than he knows what to

948
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:31,989
do with and so they're wrestling and he she licks them and then she lays down

949
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:36,159
and makes this face which is every single class I've ever showed this to

950
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:41,229
all laugh when they see that image and that's a good example so Freud said that

951
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:46,119
jokes were a good route into the unconscious so the question is and this

952
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:49,779
is an archetypal facial expression and everyone knows exactly what it means

953
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,710
there's something sexually seductive about it and something very sexually

954
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:58,359
seductive about it despite the fact that it's a lioness and the animators do an

955
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:02,229
extraordinarily good job of capturing that and so that has a huge effect on

956
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:07,779
him while these guys know that hey the game's up man it's like they know

957
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:12,849
they're dead whatever attractions they can offer are paling in comparison to

958
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:19,600
this so so anyways things don't really progress past out but you know he gets a

959
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,190
hint of her longing for him what's waiting for him if he grows up and the

960
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:27,159
fact that she's completely disappointed in him because he's so completely

961
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:32,319
useless and so now he's lounging about you know like some basement

962
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:38,500
with cheeto dust all over his chest and and trying to justify his absolutely

963
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,880
useless life and you know saying that he doesn't have any responsibility to the

964
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,929
devastated Kingdom and he's out there where Hakuna Matata you know I can just

965
01:11:46,929 --> 01:11:50,980
do whatever I want and and follow my impulsive pleasures and she thinks he's

966
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:54,669
pretty pathetic and the reason for that is because he is actually pretty

967
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:59,109
pathetic and she she tells him that you know she's extraordinarily disappointed

968
01:11:59,109 --> 01:12:04,210
he gets all pouty about it I mean even here you see when he when he's got kind

969
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,719
of an aggressive look on his face there's still nothing about it that's

970
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:12,969
commanding it's petulant right it's like well now I'm irritated but he's got no

971
01:12:12,969 --> 01:12:18,908
force and and still completely appalling in this in this particular situation so

972
01:12:18,908 --> 01:12:23,948
she judges him very harshly and leaves and that makes him think yeah he make

973
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:28,598
gets all self-conscious because this female that he admires wants to have

974
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:32,020
nothing to do with him and so he's first of all then he thinks

975
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:34,949
well maybe I'll just hate all women which is you know pretty pathetic

976
01:12:34,948 --> 01:12:39,578
conclusion and but a very common one and the next is well maybe there's actually

977
01:12:39,578 --> 01:12:43,929
something wrong with him right which is a very painful bit of self-reflection so

978
01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:48,250
he he had he notes that there's something wrong with him and then he

979
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,130
calls out to his father and says look you said you were always going to be

980
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:56,020
here for me and you're not and so what's happening is that he's become aware of

981
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,949
the insufficiency of his current adolescent value structure and he wants

982
01:12:59,948 --> 01:13:03,129
something beyond it which would be associated with identification with the

983
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:07,719
father but he can't he can't find the father the father's dead it's like when

984
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:10,929
Pinocchio goes down to the bottom of the ocean to bring Geppetto up from the

985
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:16,000
depths right that's the situation that that Simba finds himself in right now

986
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,840
the father's gone and has to be brought up from the depths so this is where the

987
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:26,980
movie takes the the archetypal pathway of an initiation ceremony so he says he

988
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:31,539
wants to change now one of the things Carl Rogers one of the clinicians that

989
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:34,448
will talk about pointed out was that if if someone was going to come to

990
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:37,689
psychotherapy there's some things that had to happen before they went into

991
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:41,529
psychotherapy and one thing that had to happen was that they had to admit that

992
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:45,550
there was something wrong and they had to want to change you had to have that

993
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,380
before went into the psychotherapeutic

994
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,909
situation and what happens here is Simba is actually he's dropped his arrogance

995
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:57,159
and he's looking upward kind of like Geppetto wishing on the star in

996
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:01,930
Pinocchio he's looking upwards he looking towards something higher and he

997
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:06,250
wants to transform himself so he's asked the question how can I change for the

998
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:13,449
better and he doesn't get an answer and then Rafiki shows up so what does that

999
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:18,069
mean it means that as soon as you know you're wrong about something as soon as

1000
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:22,210
you admit that you're wrong about something and you open the door to

1001
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:27,130
potential change that part of you will respond so and you know this because

1002
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:33,279
think about this you're thinking so you ask yourself a question because that's

1003
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:36,039
what you do when you're thinking and then you generate some answers it's like

1004
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:39,789
it's very strange the thinking will actually work you can actually come up

1005
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:43,329
with answers if you think about something and so this square this issue

1006
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:48,399
is okay I thought I was real good in my little impulsive paradise but then it

1007
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,179
turns out that I'm just a half-wit and I noticed that and I want to do something

1008
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:57,159
about so the question is now the question is has now been posed and what

1009
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,939
young would say is the deeper part of yourself the part that still contains

1010
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:06,909
your undeveloped potential will respond to that posed question and change the

1011
01:15:06,909 --> 01:15:10,239
way that you look at things and change the way that you act it'll start it'll

1012
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:14,859
start changing things so that you can tap those parts of yourself that are not

1013
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:18,579
yet developed and you certainly do that in psychotherapy but you can do that

1014
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:22,390
young said that psychotherapy could be replaced by a supreme moral effort and

1015
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,320
by that he meant was that if you really wanted things to be better if you wanted

1016
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,889
to get your act together and you admitted that you were insufficient in

1017
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,840
your current state and you meditated on the issue and tried to figure out what

1018
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,770
you should do next to make to put yourself together that you would be able

1019
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,160
to find out that there's something in you that guides the process of

1020
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:46,479
development that's the self that's a higher its the higher self in some sense

1021
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,519
it's the thing that remains constant across transformations you know because

1022
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,610
you're somewhere then you fall apart then you get somewhere else but there's

1023
01:15:54,609 --> 01:15:58,509
something outside of that that's guiding that process and that's that's also the

1024
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:02,619
self that's what you would be and you can communicate in some

1025
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:06,789
sense with what you could be and that's a very strange thing about human beings

1026
01:16:06,789 --> 01:16:11,920
anyways Rafiki shows up and Simba is sitting by the water self reflecting

1027
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,760
there's a little pebble that drops into the pool to attract his attention and up

1028
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,590
pops the self and Rafik he's a trickster he tells him weird jokes and he hits him

1029
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:25,090
with a stick a bunch of times thank God because someone really needs to and he

1030
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:30,909
he makes some stupid jokes about bananas and kind of entices Simba into following

1031
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:35,109
him right he lets him know that he has a secret and he entices Simba into

1032
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:39,609
following him so simha's all of a sudden become interested in something so if you

1033
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:43,269
ask yourself what the next developmental stages and you really want to know that

1034
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,150
all of a sudden you're going to become interested in things that might move you

1035
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:51,250
to the next stage and that'll happen more or less unconsciously so anyways

1036
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:57,460
Rafiki entices him and then runs away and Simba follows him and well that's

1037
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:03,399
where he reveals himself as a sage and then he tells Simba to follow him and he

1038
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:07,479
goes underground and this is the initiation scene right which we talked

1039
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:11,500
about at the beginning of the class this is the descent into the underworld and

1040
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:18,310
it's a it's a prerequisite to radical personality transformation so anyways he

1041
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,780
goes through this horrifying underground tunnel system where everything's all

1042
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:27,488
tangled up which is you know if you ever fall into chaos that everything down

1043
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:32,468
there in chaos is tangled up it's a tangled mess and he's quite and there's

1044
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:35,800
horrifying music going on in the background and he goes deeper and deeper

1045
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:41,289
until Rafiki says he finds a pool in the middle of the chaos a deep pool and

1046
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:45,250
that's another symbol of the self it's it's the deep unconscious to something

1047
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:50,109
down there that's alive that can be drawn up to the surface and so Rafiki

1048
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:55,689
shows him the pool and Simba who's quite terrified at this point looks in it and

1049
01:17:55,689 --> 01:17:59,799
the first thing he sees is he only sees himself he only sees his own reflection

1050
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,960
and Rafiki says look deeper now you see what the animators do here it's very

1051
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,899
cool so there's Simba and there's his

1052
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:11,259
reflection but you see that is already half is farther and you look at the

1053
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:16,719
difference in the eyebrows and the so there's a there's a tightness of jaw

1054
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,250
and a firmness of face that's starting to manifest itself there and that means

1055
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:26,050
that he's starting to see the man he could be beyond the adolescent that's a

1056
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:28,779
good way of thinking about it and then all of a sudden well they're you know

1057
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:34,500
that's a whole different face right that's a seriously different face that

1058
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,738
everything's going in and that it's like get out of my way because things are

1059
01:18:38,738 --> 01:18:42,729
going to happen around me very judgmental as well so it's not it's not

1060
01:18:42,729 --> 01:18:47,289
naive by any stretch of the imagination but you know we know as far there's a

1061
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:51,819
good guy and so there's something archetypal about this and so he sees the

1062
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:55,659
man he could be reflected back to him and then that's which is that actually

1063
01:18:55,659 --> 01:18:59,050
becomes a cosmic event and we switch up to the sky instead

1064
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:07,539
and so Mufasa manifests himself basically as a solar deity and he tells

1065
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:13,840
Simba that he's forgotten who he is which is the son of a king and that he

1066
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,480
should remember that and start acting like it

1067
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,179
and that's an archetypal idea so if you're just a useless adolescent then

1068
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:26,409
you've forgotten who you are and the consequence of that is that the state is

1069
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:30,159
going to fall around fall apart around you and you're not going to do anything

1070
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,800
to fix it and you're not going to be good for anything and no one's gonna be

1071
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,940
able to rely on you and you're gonna be all whiny and resentful and then after

1072
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:41,589
that it even gets worse and so that's basically what Mufasa tells him and so

1073
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:46,960
Simba is like blown away by this vision right because he sees what he could be

1074
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:54,460
and also what he's not which is pretty damn horrifying so anyways the storm so

1075
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:59,170
to speak clears and Rafiki comes up and and Simba's a lot more thoughtful and

1076
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:06,219
not quite as whiny and resentful anymore and Rafiki leaves and so Simba now knows

1077
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:10,469
what he's supposed to do he's supposed to stop being useless and take on the

1078
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:16,750
moral requirements of setting the Kingdom straight and so he runs back

1079
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:20,500
across the desert there's all sorts of impressive music happening and then he

1080
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:24,069
comes back to his kingdom and it's not looking so good and that's the

1081
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:27,769
consequence of his his abandonment of it that's a big

1082
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:32,090
part of it so now it's dead but also his abandonment of it - nothing but

1083
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:38,750
malevolence and chaos and so he's pretty taken aback and what's happened and that

1084
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:46,310
he exaggerates his guilt or it should anyways and neljä shows up and and they

1085
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:51,220
decide they're gonna do something about this so in the meantime

1086
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:55,399
Simba's mother is complaining about the fact that there's no food in the kingdom

1087
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,460
anymore and that they've gone as far as they can and Skaar doesn't want to hear

1088
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:05,449
this so he he attacks her and Simba decides to go to war and so this is

1089
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:10,189
where he wakes up and he's willing to encounter the shadow at this point and

1090
01:21:10,189 --> 01:21:15,319
so he confronts scar and scars very concerned about this because actually

1091
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:19,639
Simba is looking pretty impressive now and he thought he was dead besides and

1092
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:26,300
so he tries to use treachery and whiny Nessun and subordination to excuse

1093
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:33,680
himself but he's planning to overthrow Simba nonetheless to resist him so he

1094
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,420
tells scar to leave he's going to banish him to the nether regions outside of the

1095
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:45,319
kingdom like scar did to him and scar basically refuses and then a storm

1096
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:52,039
gathers right and lights the Deadwood around the rock on fire so we have

1097
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:56,600
another kind of descent into hell seen here very common in Disney movies this

1098
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,100
this this notion of the hero fighting the evil force on the edge of something

1099
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,890
that's burning it's quite a common motif you see it in Sleeping Beauty for

1100
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:09,530
example so they have a big war and scar ends up putting Simba in the same

1101
01:22:09,529 --> 01:22:13,309
position that Mufasa was in and then he whispers to him that he killed his

1102
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:17,600
father so Simba has been thinking all along that it was only his fault and it

1103
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,140
is sort of his fault but he didn't know that there was a more archetypal theme

1104
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:26,720
playing out in the background which is that societies are always endangered by

1105
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,470
malevolence always and that's independent to some degree of Simba's

1106
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:34,610
decisions and his and his lack thereof anyways scar tells him because he thinks

1107
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:40,939
he's won and that energizes Simba to have this sort of final battle he leaps

1108
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:45,379
out from the and they have a big fight and he pins

1109
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:52,819
him basically and the female lioness has come to his aid and Simba tells him that

1110
01:22:52,819 --> 01:22:56,630
again that he has to leave and so they have a big fight that's a particularly

1111
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:01,788
good bit of animation so there's real demonic aspect to scar they're sort of

1112
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:09,078
King of Hell imagery and but he loses and then ha he blames his minions he

1113
01:23:09,078 --> 01:23:11,929
blames the hyenas for everything terrible this happening forgetting that

1114
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:15,979
they can hear him and then he falls off the cliff and the hyenas go in and

1115
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:19,969
finish him off so it's pretty brutal ending for poor

1116
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:27,349
old scar eaten by his own minions and then scars dead and Simba has one and so

1117
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:30,288
the rains come immediately and so what does that mean well it means that when

1118
01:23:30,288 --> 01:23:33,978
proper order is restored in a kingdom then everything starts to flourish again

1119
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:42,920
and so the rains come and then while it's raining Simba climbs up to the top

1120
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,578
of the rock and now he's completely mature right that the facial the

1121
01:23:46,578 --> 01:23:49,609
pathetic facial expression disappears entirely knee straightens himself up

1122
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:54,018
because now he's full of serotonin after having defeated good old scar and all

1123
01:23:54,019 --> 01:24:00,380
the lionesses are roaring and he climbs up Pride Rock and they roar at him which

1124
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,710
is good they're tough and he's tough and they showing their teeth it's it's not

1125
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:10,819
it's not a society of naive and harmless creatures it's it's something that's got

1126
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:15,768
some bite and the rains come and then the next thing you see is the

1127
01:24:15,769 --> 01:24:19,280
restoration of the kingdom and so basically that what that means is that

1128
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:24,139
if the individual is willing to confront their own shadow and then to take on the

1129
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:28,550
malevolent forces that continually undermine society then harmony can be

1130
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:33,739
restored and everyone can do well and so then we have a return to the beginning

1131
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:41,439
right and so Simba and nella are now a couple along with Pumbaa and Timon and

1132
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:52,960
they have a baby and Rafiki shows up and does the same thing you know he's gonna

1133
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,980
present the baby to the Sun and have all the animals bow again and and that's the

1134
01:24:57,979 --> 01:25:03,339
end of the movie so that's all packed

1135
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:10,819
that's all packed into an archetypal tale and and so one of the things that

1136
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:16,130
young would point out is that you all understood this right while you were

1137
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:21,739
watching it because otherwise at some level all these things made sense they

1138
01:25:21,738 --> 01:25:25,250
all cohered and the narrative appeared to be an appropriate narrative even when

1139
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:30,619
you're a little kid it because it strikes a chord inside you and well that

1140
01:25:30,619 --> 01:25:34,729
chord the thing that it strikes inside you that's the archetype because if

1141
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:38,389
there wasn't something inside of you so to speak that this could communicate

1142
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:43,489
with and it would fall on deaf ears and it speaks to the part of you that's most

1143
01:25:43,488 --> 01:25:49,039
particularly human and it's a story of the development of the sovereign

1144
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:51,649
individual that's that's the right way to think about it's a hero archetype

1145
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:56,119
that's another way of thinking about it and people are going to get that story

1146
01:25:56,119 --> 01:26:00,859
one way or another and now and then a piece of public art comes along like

1147
01:26:00,859 --> 01:26:03,469
this that does a good job of encapsulating and it captures everyone's

1148
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:08,719
imagination and so that's why you've all seen it and why I presume you all

1149
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:17,449
enjoyed it when you were kids and maybe still enjoy it now so well that was

1150
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:20,179
actually faster than I thought it would be today so this is what I'm gonna do

1151
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:24,650
we've got 20 minutes so why don't you think for a minute or two and I'll take

1152
01:26:24,649 --> 01:26:28,609
some questions which I don't often do but and they can be any questions about

1153
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:38,889
anything we've covered in class so take a minute and yes

1154
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,820
- movie you feel like you know the character but

1155
01:26:48,819 --> 01:26:55,759
it's not exactly that character like become so - you know can

1156
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:02,719
like it feels like you know for a wise old man

1157
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:08,550
archetype yeah yeah well there's not much difference between Gandalf and

1158
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:12,390
who's the wizard in Harry Potter Dumbledore they could be the same guy

1159
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:18,210
it's right right and so well that that is precisely the indication of the

1160
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:23,609
existence of an archetype it's like an a movie one time a student asked me well

1161
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:26,488
if if there are these archetypes why don't we just tell the archetype over

1162
01:27:26,488 --> 01:27:30,269
and over why do we need fiction for example which is like a bridge if

1163
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:33,270
there's individuals here and the archetype is up here you know at a high

1164
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:37,440
level of abstraction fiction sort of fills the gap between them and so what

1165
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,399
you want is a story that's archetypal so that you understand its basic structure

1166
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:45,149
but you want enough variation and specificity so that it's new and

1167
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:49,529
interesting and also applicable to you so you have to humanize the archetype to

1168
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:53,969
some degree otherwise it's so abstract you can't you can't relate to it and and

1169
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:57,920
good stories really do that they bridge the gap and some of them are more

1170
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,520
personal and less archetypal but if they're completely non archetypal

1171
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,239
there's nothing about them that captures you it doesn't have any force and then

1172
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,419
if it's two archetypal well it gets to be too abstract and you can't relate to

1173
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:15,750
it so good fiction writers and and good purveyors of dramatic entertainment we

1174
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,899
think about it as entertainment are really good at occupying that middle

1175
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:23,939
position so yeah and they reveal the archetype through the individual that's

1176
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:28,589
one way of thinking about it and and that keeps it fresh and you know one of

1177
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:33,869
the things that you pointed out to was that you're you're going to be

1178
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:36,750
manifesting archetypal patterns of behavior in your life whether you know

1179
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,719
it or not even when you do something like fall in

1180
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:43,920
love because that's going to be a very particular experience for you but it's

1181
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,619
also a very common experience at the same time right and and romance is older

1182
01:28:49,619 --> 01:28:54,869
than people that's one way of looking about looking at it I mean because sex

1183
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:59,219
is older than human beings and so you're in the grip of something that's really

1184
01:28:59,219 --> 01:29:05,279
ancient but at the same time it's really personal and so a good novelist or a

1185
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:08,759
writer of fiction is able to capture both the personal element of that to

1186
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:14,489
show show the transpersonal within the personal and so and in some sense your

1187
01:29:14,488 --> 01:29:18,089
destiny property study from a union perspective is to

1188
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:23,010
consciously express an archetype and so be the archetype there's a bunch of them

1189
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:25,229
but one of them would be the archetype of the hero and you're supposed to

1190
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:29,099
manifest that in the conditions of your own life so that makes the archetype

1191
01:29:29,099 --> 01:29:34,050
real in the conditions of your own life and Jung would also say that when you're

1192
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:38,788
doing that your experience will manifest itself as meaningful and so it's because

1193
01:29:38,788 --> 01:29:41,488
in some sense you're acting in accordance with your deepest instincts

1194
01:29:41,488 --> 01:29:45,928
technically speaking right you're you're acting out what it means to be human in

1195
01:29:45,929 --> 01:29:54,618
the world and you're gonna find that meaningful so yes

1196
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,920
like

1197
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:19,199
like I just like because it's mine

1198
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:27,058
process from life like happy but is like appreciating to

1199
01:30:27,059 --> 01:30:30,199
help so like

1200
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:36,259
you know like love and subsidies

1201
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:45,270
okay so the question is about the relationship between the shadow and the

1202
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:53,489
okay so the first thing you have to understand with regards to trying to

1203
01:30:53,488 --> 01:30:56,789
come to terms with the conception of the shadow is to understand the idea of

1204
01:30:56,789 --> 01:31:02,159
persona and persona is the you that you present when you want people to accept

1205
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:13,920
and like you often like let's say that you go to a party and you're trying to

1206
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,159
impress the people that are there and you're trying to get them to like you

1207
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:23,460
and so you maybe get jabbed out a little bit and you laugh and you know you're

1208
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:27,180
you go along with everyone so that they like you and then you go home and you're

1209
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,260
bitterly resentful about the way that you were put down at this party and

1210
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:35,190
that's going to make all sorts of aggressive I wish I could have said it's

1211
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:39,359
gonna make all sorts of aggressive and vengeful thoughts sort of flashed

1212
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,969
through your imagination well the first part of the problem is that you were too

1213
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:48,750
much persona right you sacrificed yourself in some sense at the party so

1214
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:54,180
that people would like you and in the second part you're refusing to admit to

1215
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:57,930
the existence of those elements of you that would have actually protected you

1216
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,920
from doing that so let's say you go home and you're all bitter and resentful and

1217
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,199
you have fantasies of revenge I mean that reveals to you the shadow part of

1218
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:11,099
you that's aggressive and the thing is you actually need that because if you

1219
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:14,670
would have integrated that more successfully into your personality when

1220
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:17,789
you went to the party you wouldn't have had lit you wouldn't have had to let

1221
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:21,779
people put you down to get them to like you you know instead of having a face

1222
01:32:21,779 --> 01:32:27,059
like this which says I'll take anything that's coming my way you know you have a

1223
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:31,830
face and a stance that's more determined and assertive and if you manifest that

1224
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:34,159
properly people aren't gonna mess with you to begin with

1225
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:38,250
but you know you may have already adopted a morality that says well I have

1226
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,699
to be likeable and I shouldn't do anything that causes any conflict and I

1227
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:46,199
shouldn't ever you know hurt anybody's feelings and so you're just to present

1228
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:50,219
yourself as a punching bag and you think that that makes you a good person but it

1229
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:54,300
doesn't and there's no integration of the shadow in that situation

1230
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:59,020
so you see that at the end of the movie we know I mentioned this when Simba

1231
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:02,560
climbs up the rock to take control of it all the female lionesses bare their

1232
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,420
teeth and he roars it's like that aggressiveness is integrated into him

1233
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:13,239
and so resentment is a really good emotion for making contact with the

1234
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:17,948
shadow side because if you're resentful about something it basically reveals two

1235
01:33:17,948 --> 01:33:22,149
things it either means that you're immature and you should stop whining and

1236
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:26,139
get on with things you know someone's ass this often happens with adolescents

1237
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:29,500
who are asked say by their mother to clean up the room they get all resentful

1238
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,279
about it it's like shut up and clean up your room you know it's not that much to

1239
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:40,019
ask or so that can be a gateway into the observation of your own immaturity or

1240
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:44,560
it's possible that you're resentful because people really have been poking

1241
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:49,510
at you too much and taking and and taking shots at you and oppressing you

1242
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:53,770
but what that means is that you've got some things to say that you haven't been

1243
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:58,270
willing to say or don't know how to say right you can't stand up for yourself

1244
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:02,830
properly and in order to do that you have to grow some teeth and be willing

1245
01:34:02,829 --> 01:34:06,189
to use them and again that's something that might violate your morality because

1246
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:11,738
you might say well I shouldn't be able to bite people and the thing is yes you

1247
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:15,579
should be able to bite people hard and if you're able to bite them then

1248
01:34:15,579 --> 01:34:19,689
generally you don't have to but they need to know that you can because

1249
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:23,259
otherwise especially people who are badly socialized they'll just keep

1250
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:26,469
encroaching on you and encroaching on you and encroaching on you and

1251
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:31,510
encroaching on you until you you put up a wall like someone who's really well

1252
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:37,420
put together won't do that you know because they're sophisticated but if you

1253
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:41,710
run into people who only have boundaries because other people impose them on them

1254
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:46,300
and you won't do it you're gonna be the bullied one in the office for example

1255
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:50,380
you're not gonna get a raise people aren't gonna credit you with your own

1256
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:54,130
work other people are gonna take credit for it you know and you're gonna go home

1257
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:57,460
angry because you're doing your best and you're trying to get along with everyone

1258
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:03,399
and nothing ever goes your way well it's because you're a pushover and you think

1259
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:07,779
that's good because you confuse harmlessness with with with

1260
01:35:07,779 --> 01:35:11,859
reality it's it's about it's not right just because you can't do any damage

1261
01:35:11,859 --> 01:35:16,329
doesn't mean your morale just means your you don't have the capability for mayhem

1262
01:35:16,329 --> 01:35:21,850
and that makes you a pushover I mean the yogya stuff is very very dark you know

1263
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:27,340
it's very dark because his notion of what constitutes a moral human being is

1264
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:32,619
much different from the typical view he really thinks you get that horrible side

1265
01:35:32,619 --> 01:35:36,340
of yourself integrated so it's up there where you can use it because otherwise

1266
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:43,150
you're you're dangerous you can't say no to people and you'll go along with the

1267
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:46,809
crowd and then if the crowd does something particularly pathological

1268
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:50,800
which it's liable to do you won't be able to resist it you won't have the

1269
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:57,039
strength of character and so then you'll fall prey to to crowd pathology and

1270
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:01,180
it'll be because you're too agreeable with a you know with a shadow resentful

1271
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:15,940
side that the crowd and its murderous intent is gonna act out so yes yes so

1272
01:36:15,939 --> 01:36:20,409
the question is the relationship between archetype archetypes and the idea of

1273
01:36:20,409 --> 01:36:25,090
memes well oh yeah that's a complicated one so

1274
01:36:25,090 --> 01:36:28,390
Richard Dawkins was the guy who originated the idea of meme and his

1275
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:33,700
notion was that you could produce an idea or a set of ideas that had the

1276
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:38,800
capacity to propagate across minds for whatever reason it was catchy let's say

1277
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,500
like a like a song that gets stuck in your head you know it and that those he

1278
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:51,010
called those memes which was sort of a play on the idea of genes so there are

1279
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:56,500
these stable sets of ideas that can be transferred across minds well I've often

1280
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,590
thought when I was reading Dawkins that if he would have kept thinking he would

1281
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:03,940
have turned into Carl Jung because an archetype is a meme but it's a really

1282
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:08,229
really really deep meme so you can imagine that an idea has been sold

1283
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:14,349
around for so long and that people have acted out for so long that it's actually

1284
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:21,240
become part of the landscape that does the selection so think about it this way

1285
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:32,450
so it's more or less a truism that if you take a male dominance hierarchy the

1286
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:35,929
probability that the men at the top of the hierarchy will leave offspring is

1287
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:38,659
much higher than the probability that the men at the bottom will leave

1288
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:42,649
offspring and it's true in many many species now there's a much higher

1289
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:47,019
probability of the average female leaving offspring than the average man

1290
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:53,840
so so now then imagine that there's characteristics that push a man up a

1291
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,890
dominance hierarchy okay and then imagine that there are characteristics

1292
01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:03,950
that push a man up a set of dominance hierarchies so that each dominance

1293
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:06,800
hierarchy has something in common with all of the others it's sort of like the

1294
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:13,340
idea of a good player of a game being a good sport across games so then imagine

1295
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:22,550
that the idea of the successful male starts to become encapsulated in in in

1296
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:27,560
biology because this species is going to the male part of the species at least is

1297
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:32,450
going to be adapting to the selection pressures placed on the male by the male

1298
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:36,170
dominance hierarchy so what happens is you have a competition between men the

1299
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:39,260
men that win the competition find partners in mate

1300
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:45,230
so the the male is going to start to adapt to the fact of the selection

1301
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:48,679
that's implemented by the dominance hierarchy then you can imagine that

1302
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,630
that's going to take case take place across dominance hierarchies because

1303
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:58,250
this is happening in many many situations spread across time and so

1304
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:05,510
then the idea of how the proper man should act starts to become incorporated

1305
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:09,829
in the biology and also in the expectations of the society and then

1306
01:39:09,829 --> 01:39:14,380
that starts to loop so as the expectations become clearer and clearer

1307
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,369
the notion of what it constitutes success becomes clearer and clearer as

1308
01:39:19,369 --> 01:39:23,869
well and the two things get tangled together now and I think you can see

1309
01:39:23,869 --> 01:39:30,109
that a manifestation of that whenever you go watch a movie because you

1310
01:39:30,109 --> 01:39:35,210
immediately identify the hero and you identify with them it's like he's

1311
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:40,399
the person that your mythological imagination grasps on to and you play

1312
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,750
that out using your body as a representational platform when you watch

1313
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:49,819
the movie and so maybe you admire the hero if he's a successful hero you do

1314
01:39:49,819 --> 01:39:53,719
well that admiration is the manifestation of the instinct that

1315
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:58,460
drives you towards that kind of behavior and not only can you manifest it in

1316
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,969
which case you're likely to feel good about yourself because you know that

1317
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:05,810
sometimes you can feel good about yourself and sometimes not but you're

1318
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:09,440
also going to be able to recognize it when you see it in the world and that's

1319
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,159
going to manifest itself in admiration and admiration is the proclivity to

1320
01:40:13,159 --> 01:40:21,889
imitate so the meme can be soul so you can imagine dominance hierarchies are

1321
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,739
very very old they're like 300 million years old

1322
01:40:24,738 --> 01:40:29,539
they've been around a very long time and the idea that we have an image of what

1323
01:40:29,539 --> 01:40:35,238
it takes to climb the dominant targets it's more or less self-evident because

1324
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:40,669
that's the landscape that selected us and at the same time you know the the

1325
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:45,829
archetype the pattern that propagates you up the dominant arc is also the same

1326
01:40:45,829 --> 01:40:50,439
pattern that makes you attractive to women they're the same thing

1327
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:56,119
so and of course that's a massively powerful selection mechanism and sexual

1328
01:40:56,119 --> 01:41:00,260
selection has really shaped human beings it's turned us into what we are and

1329
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:04,219
that's an interesting thing too because you know this is one of the things that

1330
01:41:04,219 --> 01:41:10,689
really bothers me about the emphasis of evolutionary scientists on randomness

1331
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:15,769
it's like the the general mutation generation process is random or quasi

1332
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:19,190
random we don't know that for sure because there is evidence now that you

1333
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:23,539
can inherit acquired characteristics and that was nobody thought that was

1334
01:41:23,539 --> 01:41:27,769
possible 20 years ago so things are have taken a very weird twist in the

1335
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:31,670
Darwinian world but for the sake of argument we could say that the mutation

1336
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:36,980
process is random but the selection process isn't random it's not even close

1337
01:41:36,979 --> 01:41:42,109
to random ever since creatures have been able to evaluate one another the

1338
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:47,569
selection process hasn't been random and so basically we're selected by you could

1339
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:51,409
say by the manifestation of mind in the world unless you believe

1340
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:55,970
that women for example exercise no conscious choice in their made selection

1341
01:41:55,970 --> 01:42:00,560
which seems completely absurd first of all men consciously choose who's going

1342
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,400
to lead them at least in part you know who's going to succeed in a hierarchy

1343
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:09,079
and women consciously choose their sexual partners so the idea that the

1344
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:14,239
selection process that the evolutionary process is random is it's an absurd

1345
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:18,500
proposition sexual selection makes it non-random and Darwin knew that he

1346
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:23,029
emphasized sexual selection a lot but modern biologists since the time of

1347
01:42:23,029 --> 01:42:27,619
Darwin except for the last about twenty years down played the role of sexual

1348
01:42:27,619 --> 01:42:33,279
selection and I think the reason for that is that it brings mind into the

1349
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:38,300
evolutionary process in a way that they don't like and no wonder it's

1350
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:42,230
complicated you know it's like to some degree we're consciously directing our

1351
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:48,549
own evolution at least through the mechanism of selection so

1352
01:42:55,079 --> 01:43:00,340
yes yes well Dawkins just thought of memes is something that weren't he never

1353
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,190
thought about them is something that could last long enough to play a role in

1354
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:08,379
selection itself you know he thought about the Moroz parasitical cognitive

1355
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:12,609
entities I would say that just sort of floated on the surface of the mental

1356
01:43:12,609 --> 01:43:18,069
landscape he never he never grappled with the idea that a meme could be

1357
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:24,989
something that could last for hundreds of millions of years roughly speaking so

1358
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:34,569
we got time for one more question if anybody has yes yes from a political

1359
01:43:34,569 --> 01:43:38,139
perspective like if you divide people by their political affiliation it looks

1360
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:45,280
like liberal men are the most unhappy they're higher in neuroticism

1361
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:49,719
I think the openness probably contributes to it as well but we don't

1362
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:53,560
and also possibly the low conscientiousness when my graduate

1363
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,440
students come in or one of the many ways we're gonna talk about this in some

1364
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:59,589
detail because she's going to tell you because we've also looked at the

1365
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:02,980
personality predictors of political correctness which is extraordinarily

1366
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:06,909
interesting as well because it doesn't really seem to fall exactly on the

1367
01:44:06,909 --> 01:44:11,800
liberal conservative continuum so we'll talk more about that when we get into

1368
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:17,020
the Big Five part of the course okay good we'll see you on Thursday when

1369
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:25,530
we're going to do a speed review of Freud

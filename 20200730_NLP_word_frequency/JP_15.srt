[Music]

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,580
I called the course personality and its

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,320
transformations and I think you could

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,109
think about that as a restatement of the

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,699
idea of being and becoming and that's

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,640
what you are you're for whatever that

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,789
means you're an entity that both is and

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,649
is transforming and there's a rule that

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:34,700
goes along with that by the way which is

10
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:36,859
don't sacrifice who you could be for who

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,690
you are which means if you have to

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:40,250
choose to transform in a positive

13
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:43,189
direction or maintain your current

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,539
position then it's better to transform

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:46,429
in a positive direction so you might

16
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,759
even think of that as the core of your

17
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,469
being

18
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,838
that's a piagetian idea it's a union

19
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,908
idea as well who are you you're the

20
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:55,250
thing that transforms who you are now

21
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:57,018
you're also who you are but on top of

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,149
that you're the thing that transforms

23
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:01,250
who you are and I do think that that's

24
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,459
and that's not an arbitrary statement

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,060
you know one of the things that modern

26
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:11,599
universities do dreadfully now is

27
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,019
convince their students that value

28
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,459
structures are relative and that and

29
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:18,199
that's a that's a big mistake it's

30
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,059
there's a lot of things wrong with that

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,469
idea and one of the things that's wrong

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,689
with that ideas that doesn't include

33
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:25,728
what I just mentioned which is that's a

34
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:26,809
good moral rule is you are the thing

35
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:29,118
that is and you're the thing that

36
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,368
becomes and you should put the thing

37
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,989
that becomes at a higher place than the

38
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:34,728
thing that is that means you also have

39
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:36,968
to allow yourself to shake off those

40
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:40,099
things about you that you might be

41
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:42,108
pathologically attached to habits and

42
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,640
people for that matter ways of thinking

43
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:45,500
all of those things you have to allow

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,329
yourself to shake those off and that's

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,099
more like a burning that's why the

46
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:51,349
Phoenix is that's why the Phoenix is the

47
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,149
symbol that it is right it's all in a

48
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:55,069
deteriorate so bursts into flame and

49
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,200
then it's reborn it's like well do you

50
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:58,669
want to be reborn like that's not the

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,499
question the question is do you want to

52
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,840
burst into flame and the answer to that

53
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:05,449
generally is no but that's the wrong

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,719
answer the right answer is you let all

55
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,399
that nonsense burn away and you know and

56
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,930
you might say well I don't know what I

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,568
should leave behind and the answer to

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,770
that is that's a lie you know some of

59
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,359
the things that you should leave behind

60
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,460
you all you have to do is ask yourself

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,960
you'll come up with a list instantly of

62
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,550
a hundred stupid things that you're

63
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,230
doing that you know you could stop doing

64
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,400
some of them maybe you don't know you

65
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:27,709
could stop doing

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,030
well fine leave those alone for now but

67
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,709
there's a bunch of things you perfectly

68
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,188
know well that you could stop doing that

69
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,019
would improve your life and so do that

70
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,759
see what happens that's a good that's a

71
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,219
good idea

72
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:42,318
all right so it's personality and its

73
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,180
transformations because partly I wanted

74
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,030
to talk to you about talk to you about

75
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,120
what you are as a human being and also

76
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,949
as an individual but also what you could

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,230
become and that's actually a crucial

78
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,818
question in the domains of clinical

79
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,048
psychology in particular because a lot

80
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:59,419
of what you're doing with people as a

81
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,040
clinician is trying to figure out who

82
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,958
they could become that's right you come

83
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,269
you have a problem your life isn't what

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,639
it could be it's like fine let's see

85
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,620
what it could be like if we changed it

86
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,930
we'll figure out how to change it that's

87
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,039
got to be a negotiated dialogue right

88
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,870
because like I don't know what the hell

89
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,489
you should do with your life I can help

90
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,989
you figure it out maybe we can talk

91
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,878
about it but you are the person who has

92
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,980
to decide if the things that you're

93
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,479
aiming for you know get you out of bed

94
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,219
in the morning because that's really the

95
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,899
that's at least one of the crucial

96
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,400
issues so you got to specify the goal

97
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,139
and then you go to specify the

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,819
transformation processes and start

99
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,019
practicing them and you have to

100
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,369
understand that you're going to be bad

101
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,769
at it but it doesn't matter because

102
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,549
Bad's fine persistence is what you need

103
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:44,439
to be if you persist with tiny

104
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:48,260
improvements if you persist you win so

105
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:51,259
okay so in a broader you know in a

106
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,340
broader context you can think about this

107
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:56,239
as a more fundamental ontological

108
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,408
question so one the one question is how

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,979
you should act to the world the other

110
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:02,899
question is well what is the world and

111
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,669
that's a complicated problem this this

112
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,019
is a scientific answer to that question

113
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,299
and that is that the world is a

114
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,479
collection of objective phenomena and

115
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,659
that's a very powerful perspective and

116
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,979
we have a good method for determining

117
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:19,009
what the world is like as a collection

118
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:20,538
of objective phenomena and and that's

119
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,839
made us very technologically powerful

120
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:26,538
and so more power to us and all that but

121
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,579
leaves a question unanswered and the

122
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:30,050
question is well the world isn't just a

123
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,870
place of objective phenomena because

124
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,538
it's not a panoply of inert matter it

125
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,668
has living conscious creatures in it and

126
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:38,779
that's a different they're a different

127
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:41,859
order of be

128
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:45,019
and the fundamental issue for conscious

129
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,879
active creatures is not what is the

130
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,529
world from an objective perspective but

131
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,259
how it is it that you should conduct

132
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:52,789
yourself in the world and that's a and

133
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,409
there's a very there's a kind of

134
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,730
unbridgeable gap between those two

135
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,439
domains of inquiry and I think the

136
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:02,660
reason for that is that there's a the

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,069
scientific method removes value from its

138
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,230
description so that's actually what it

139
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,969
does and so once you're left with value

140
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,910
free descriptions it's very difficult to

141
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,620
extract out a value proposition from

142
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,270
them because you've that's the

143
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,649
scientific method removes the value

144
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,049
propositions you're supposed to be left

145
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,939
with only that which is objective right

146
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,860
and value propositions are in the domain

147
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,529
of the subjective so I think the idea

148
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,290
that you can derive what you should be

149
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:29,959
or do from a collection of facts is

150
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,730
flawed a because the collecting the

151
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,039
facts themselves gets rid of the value

152
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,780
structure but B there's an infinite

153
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,069
number of facts and so which how are you

154
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,489
gonna pick which ones should guide you

155
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:43,219
you can't you can't you you have to do

156
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,410
something else the facts do not tell you

157
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,090
what to do with the facts you need

158
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,700
something else to help you figure that

159
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:51,889
out well it's come to me over the years

160
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,199
that that's what essentially that's what

161
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,360
the narrative cognitive framework does

162
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,800
it's the framework that we use to

163
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,810
specify how we should act in the world

164
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,420
and so you could divide the world into

165
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,129
the world as it is and the world as

166
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,230
perhaps it should be

167
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,939
that gives you some direction and you

168
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,100
need that and we know this technically

169
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:13,040
right you need direction the reason for

170
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,530
that is its direction that produces the

171
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,400
primary that produces primary positive

172
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,839
emotion and so if you need positive

173
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,549
emotion to move through life which you

174
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,439
do because you can't even move without

175
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,240
positive emotion and also positive

176
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,399
emotion is a good bulwark against terror

177
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,410
and pain if you need those things then

178
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,169
you need direction you need a goal you

179
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,990
need a value structure so that doesn't

180
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,490
seem particularly disputable to me you

181
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,230
could still say well what value

182
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,210
structure it's like okay fine that's a

183
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,340
good question but I was you know I've

184
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,989
thought a lot about that too so if we're

185
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,189
gonna adopt a value structure there's a

186
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,449
couple of rules that go along with it

187
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,160
and this is why the bloody post

188
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,550
modernists are wrong as far as I can

189
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,530
tell is a it can't just be my

190
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,780
value structure because I'm stuck with

191
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:59,299
you and we're both stuck with all these

192
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:01,699
other people and so if I'm going to lay

193
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,230
out a value structure which is a way of

194
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,089
interpreting the world let's say and

195
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,740
there's an infinite number of potential

196
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,719
ways of interpreting the world it's like

197
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,490
the out fine no problem except that I

198
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,710
have to interpret the world in a way

199
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,329
that I can use while I'm dealing with

200
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,979
you and the world two of us are dealing

201
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,899
with everyone else and while all of you

202
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,759
are dealing with everyone else and so

203
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,620
that that's the piagetian game

204
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,810
proposition if you want to be a popular

205
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,310
kid on the playground you better play

206
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,980
games that other people want to play

207
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,079
that's a brilliant brilliant brilliant

208
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,200
observation and I told you that Piaget

209
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,969
was trying to heal the rift between

210
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,680
science and religion and that's one of

211
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,840
the things that he did that he thought

212
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,250
helped do that his question is well

213
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,829
where the moral judgments come from

214
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,629
well they partly come emerge as a

215
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,519
consequence of consensus and it's a

216
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,259
bounded domain if we're gonna if we're

217
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,569
gonna occupy the same space for any

218
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,509
length of time and those are two

219
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:56,240
critical propositions the same space and

220
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,939
a long time then we have to figure out

221
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,040
how to play an iterative game that

222
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,990
doesn't spiral downward hopefully that

223
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,180
might even improve that we both don't

224
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,490
object to because otherwise it's not

225
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,500
gonna work right you'll walk away and

226
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,449
play another game or the game will will

227
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,269
disintegrate catastrophically so there's

228
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,920
massive social constraint on what

229
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,620
constitutes an appropriate frame of

230
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,509
reference so so much for the relativist

231
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,879
argument and then there's another issue

232
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,620
that's equally relevant and it's

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,659
associated with the idea of objective

234
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,129
reality to some degree but it's not

235
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,510
exactly it's not that's not exactly

236
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,389
correct because it's not exactly

237
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,069
objective reality let's say that you and

238
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,139
I decide to occupy the same place for

239
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,210
some substantial amount of time and we

240
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,059
figured out how to solve the problem of

241
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,500
being together but you and I still have

242
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,359
to figure out how to solve the problem

243
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,970
of being together in a manner that

244
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,070
doesn't make the world object too much

245
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,110
and it isn't just other people although

246
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,670
that's a huge part of the world you want

247
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,440
them to know what object you may even

248
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:56,389
want them to support you that would even

249
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,090
be better but you also have to deal with

250
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,960
the you know the the the tendency of

251
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,030
matter to object because so your mode of

252
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,410
being in the world

253
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:08,419
your interpretive framework

254
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:11,778
as a description of how you should act

255
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:14,028
is actually the laying out of a strategy

256
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:15,889
that will produce the ends that it

257
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,139
predicts which are the things that you

258
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,669
want so this is the pragmatist

259
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,740
perspective this was worked out by

260
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:24,198
William James and his people back in the

261
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,688
late 1800s in New England the only

262
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:28,969
genuine brand of American philosophy and

263
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:31,250
what the pragmatist said is how do you

264
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,290
decide if something's true the answer is

265
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,480
how the hell can you you don't know

266
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:37,309
anything well that's true but that isn't

267
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,720
helpful because there you're stuck with

268
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,609
the problem of how to be in the world

269
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,259
well so what you do is you lay out a

270
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,568
mode of interpretation that has an

271
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,639
endpoint and then you run the mode of

272
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:48,559
interpretation embodied right because

273
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,299
you act it out and if it doesn't produce

274
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,338
the outcome then it's not let's say true

275
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:57,198
the claims within it aren't they're not

276
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,800
true by the definition of the game

277
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,389
itself

278
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,278
so you might say well you're a kid on a

279
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,049
playground you want to play a game one

280
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,870
of the implicit demands is that the game

281
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,458
is fun if it's not fun it's not worth

282
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,078
playing so you play it for a while and

283
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,729
then you see well was that fun if the

284
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,888
answer is yes then you keep playing the

285
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,659
game you say well that game is it's good

286
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,519
enough it's accurate enough it's true

287
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:18,469
enough and so you lay out

288
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,328
interpretations in the world and they're

289
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,860
subject to massive constraints other

290
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,568
people have to go along with them and

291
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,519
cooperate with you because if they don't

292
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:28,610
then look the hell out like it's a major

293
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,198
serious non-trivial constraint and then

294
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,568
the other thing is well social proof

295
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:34,879
isn't good enough it also has to work in

296
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:36,979
the world outside of the social world

297
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,568
you know so if you have an illness and

298
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,360
you have some hypothesis about how to

299
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:43,149
construe it you might say well is my

300
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,500
understanding of the illness correct

301
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,448
well it implies that I take these

302
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,429
actions well how do you know if it's

303
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:51,438
correct while you take the actions and

304
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,359
if the illness gets worse then by the

305
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:54,828
definitions that are implicit in the

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,009
framework of reference that you're using

307
00:10:54,828 --> 00:11:00,049
you've made an error and so there's no

308
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:01,490
relativism in that you could still say

309
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,740
well there's a lot of potential

310
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,019
solutions to any potential set of

311
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,730
problems it's like yeah yeah there's

312
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,669
lots of different ways to play chess on

313
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,500
the on a single board right but that

314
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,269
doesn't mean that any old solution is as

315
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,740
good as any other solution it doesn't

316
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,318
mean that at all

317
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,970
so okay so then we're looking at things

318
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:22,038
two ways we're trying to figure out well

319
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,569
how does the world present itself and

320
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:27,889
then how is it that you should act in it

321
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:29,988
and so well there's other there's other

322
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,548
constraints on the mechanisms of

323
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,099
interpretation that you place in the

324
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:36,019
world so we could say well you're

325
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:37,519
constrained in your interpretations by

326
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,198
the constraints that other people place

327
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,849
on you but there's internal constraints

328
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,408
as well we talked about those mostly

329
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:44,749
from a biological perspective because

330
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:48,139
you could also regard yourself in some

331
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:49,879
sense as a loose internal society that's

332
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,528
sort of a psychoanalytic dictum right

333
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,089
you're you're a collection of sub

334
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:55,249
personalities or you could say your

335
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,789
collection of subroutines I don't care

336
00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:00,918
how you how you formulate it but you're

337
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:02,778
a unity but you're a you're a universe

338
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:05,418
unity that brings together a plurality

339
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:07,548
of sub components and part of the

340
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:09,139
constraints on how it is that you lay

341
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:11,139
out your interpretation of the world is

342
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,818
that you have to satisfy those internal

343
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,769
subsystems right so you're the ego but

344
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,658
it's more like you're the captain of a

345
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,818
ship full of people who were rowing you

346
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:22,249
got to keep the people rowing you're not

347
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:23,899
you know a tyrant you're not an impotent

348
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:25,308
tyrant of your own destiny you're

349
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,168
constrained by the nature of your own

350
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:28,608
being and so you have to provide

351
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:29,928
yourself with food and you have to

352
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:31,519
provide yourself with shelter and you

353
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:33,588
have to provide yourself with water and

354
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,389
all of these things and and those are

355
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,519
demands that are laid on you by the

356
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,859
nature of your internal processes and of

357
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,019
course how they lay themselves out as

358
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:44,149
demands and what the appropriate

359
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,058
solutions to that is to those problems

360
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,278
are is is debatable infinitely but you

361
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,688
can see that constraints stack up you

362
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,208
have to satisfy your internal

363
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:54,978
constraints so they have to be brought

364
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,899
into a unity that seems to happen at

365
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,908
least in part but between the ages of

366
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,038
two and something like between the ages

367
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,359
of birth and four years old maybe even

368
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,769
two years old you bring yourself

369
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:05,599
together into something that's sort of

370
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,879
functioning as a unity then you have to

371
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:09,829
turn that unity into a unity that can

372
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,438
function in the social world in with

373
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:14,178
increasing breath and that unity in the

374
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:15,738
social world has to be a unity that can

375
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:17,328
function inside the natural world it's

376
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:20,359
something like that so it's you're

377
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:23,178
stacking up these games into a hierarchy

378
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:25,249
of increasing complexity and one of the

379
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,808
questions that emerges from that is well

380
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,009
what should be at the top of the

381
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,658
hierarchy if it's a hierarchical

382
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,459
structure it has to be a hierarchical

383
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:33,620
structure because some things have to be

384
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,539
worth doing more than others or

385
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,470
you can't act which is another thing I

386
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,528
really don't like about the

387
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,300
postmodernist ethos because it claims

388
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:43,370
that value structures are there to

389
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,129
eliminate to exclude and oppress and

390
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,659
never once notices that well yeah fair

391
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,850
enough but value structures are also

392
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,769
there so that you know which way to walk

393
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,300
because you can't figure out which way

394
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,710
to walk without saying that that

395
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,309
direction is preferable to that

396
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,139
direction

397
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:59,929
so you stuck with the damn things and

398
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,000
and they do exclude obviously category

399
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:03,229
structures exclude the question is if

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,139
you're going to have a value structure

401
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,879
how is it that it should be constituted

402
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,370
well ready to describe some of the

403
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,259
constraints like if your value structure

404
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,509
is perfectly functioning except that you

405
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,939
don't get enough to eat that turns out

406
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,679
actually to be a fatal problem right and

407
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,839
it might be you can run into all sorts

408
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,879
of fatal problems you're too lonesome

409
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,830
while means you're let's say that your

410
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,299
value structures too narcissistic

411
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,009
there's lots of reasons to be lonesome

412
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,719
but that might be one of them or you're

413
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:31,850
too timid or something like that like

414
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,820
you're gonna be informed by your own

415
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,259
internal biological mechanisms when the

416
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,778
value structure that you're laying out

417
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:42,350
in the world is insufficient to keep

418
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:44,088
itself propagating across time and some

419
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,290
of that's just you and some of that's

420
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,360
other people in some of that's the

421
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:49,309
natural world constraints galore and so

422
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,339
in the phase of all those constraints

423
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:55,099
and absolutely unreasonable to say and

424
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,630
the old solution goes try it generate a

425
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,389
random solution run it as a simulation

426
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,309
in the world and see and see how many

427
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,319
slings and arrows come your way they'll

428
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:05,000
be plenty and you might say well I don't

429
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,800
care about slings and arrows it's like

430
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,429
ya know that's a claim you don't get to

431
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:15,259
make so okay so you know you're you're

432
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:17,088
being informed internally as to the

433
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,708
nature of your value structure you have

434
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,209
to specify where you are you have to

435
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,669
specify where you're going you have to

436
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:25,429
integrate all your underlying biological

437
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:26,958
mechanisms into that into that schema

438
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,849
it's something I think that's actually

439
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,149
kind of weak about the P a jetty an idea

440
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,009
say because Piaget a great fan of Piaget

441
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,809
but Piaget tended to think that the

442
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,909
child came into the world with nothing

443
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:40,219
but a set of reflexes and that's his

444
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:42,319
technical claim and that the boots drop

445
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,029
off those reflexes and I think that's it

446
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,829
underestimates the degree to which the

447
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,149
child comes into the world as it already

448
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:49,399
prepared unit

449
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,870
and I mean he just thought of those

450
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,399
things that's so self-evident that you

451
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,230
don't need to talk about them but that's

452
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,179
actually not true you do need to talk

453
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,710
about them we know for example that if

454
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:00,199
you provide children with food and

455
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,879
shelter and an adequate food and shelter

456
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,070
but you don't interact with them

457
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,830
socially almost all of them die in the

458
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,990
first year right it's not optional touch

459
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,150
is not optional for children attention

460
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,820
is not optional for children play is not

461
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,409
optional for children so it isn't just

462
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,180
like well the child comes in to the

463
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:19,100
world with a set of reflexes and can

464
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,989
adapt to any old environments like no

465
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,540
the environment has to be structured in

466
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,190
a certain way or the child will die and

467
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,689
it's very interesting when it comes to

468
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,220
things like play and touch because you

469
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,960
wouldn't think of those as fundamental

470
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,060
necessities right but it turns out that

471
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,089
they are if you deprive a child badly

472
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,949
enough of play and touch in the first

473
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,900
three years of their life even if they

474
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,339
survive what comes out at the end of

475
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,379
that is often something that's like

476
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,779
barely recognizable as a functional

477
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,909
human being and cannot be repaired after

478
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,889
that point and that that experiment was

479
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:52,069
done with Romanian orphans back in the

480
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,949
back in the 90s so it was it was an ugly

481
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,240
situation to say the least

482
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,980
okay so now you take these underlying

483
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,690
biological systems and maybe they

484
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,490
aggregate themselves into something that

485
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,440
vaguely looks like your temperament your

486
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,088
your five temperamental dimensions so

487
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,189
maybe if you're an extrovert you're

488
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,899
dominated by the dopaminergic system

489
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,300
just like you are is if you're high an

490
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,640
openness and if you're if you're you

491
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,019
know if you're high in eroticism it's

492
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,020
mostly that you're dominated by anxiety

493
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,939
systems and systems that mean mediate

494
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,769
emotional pain and if you're agreeable

495
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,929
you're dominated by the function of the

496
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:26,689
underlying maternal slash care

497
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:29,269
affiliation systems but so you could say

498
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,960
well you've got these loose you've got a

499
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:33,920
multitude of fundamental biological

500
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,350
predispositions that manifest themselves

501
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,450
as implicit stories something like that

502
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,399
and they organize themselves into the

503
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,819
primary temperaments and the primary

504
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,740
temperaments are biasing factors that

505
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,029
determine in part the nature of the

506
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,319
interpretive structure that you're going

507
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:50,058
to lay out in the world it's not

508
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,529
entirely determined by your temperament

509
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,569
we know that personality is only

510
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,970
predicting you know something like let's

511
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,980
say 10% of the variance in most complex

512
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,319
social outcomes and and the other

513
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,980
elements are well temperamental as you

514
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,298
might be used

515
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,548
have to get along with other people in

516
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:06,289
the world so you you know you come in

517
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:08,240
with these internal biases but they have

518
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,119
still have to be modified extensively by

519
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,819
your social and your natural surround

520
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:16,428
okay and then you develop your routines

521
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:18,019
from the bottom up as Piaget pointed out

522
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,150
and sometimes from the top down because

523
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,400
now and then you can think yourself into

524
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,259
a radical transformation but mostly what

525
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,150
you're doing is building the micro units

526
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:28,308
of your interpretive schemas and your

527
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,470
behaviors and aggregating them into

528
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:32,928
higher order structures that you can

529
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,940
then tag with higher order abstractions

530
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,040
and we talked about that you can't tell

531
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,019
a three-year-old to clean up his room

532
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,970
and the reason for that is he those are

533
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,940
empty boxes as far as the kid's

534
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:46,460
concerned clean he's doing he might he

535
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,620
might have room he might have that clean

536
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,259
he doesn't have he might have pick up

537
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,029
the teddy bear and put it in that space

538
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,640
right so that's one of these little

539
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,440
micro routines and maybe you say you put

540
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,179
20 of those micro routines together and

541
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,830
now you can say clean up your room and

542
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,570
basically what you're saying is here's

543
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:04,849
implement the 10 micro routines that

544
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:07,308
you've learned and so a well-functioning

545
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:09,079
personality has all the micro routines

546
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:10,609
in place that's actually something that

547
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,379
you help people with if you're a

548
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:14,418
behavioral therapist because one of the

549
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,130
things you assume if you're a behavioral

550
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,410
therapist is that sometimes the reason

551
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,720
people aren't doing things is because

552
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,220
they don't know how you know sometimes

553
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,140
maybe the person is depressed but

554
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,058
potentially high-functioning they got

555
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,190
all the damn micro routines they're well

556
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:29,808
socialized they're just dormant you got

557
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,610
to get them awake again and implementing

558
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:33,079
them but sometimes you get someone in

559
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,899
your in your practice say who's just

560
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,369
been neglected like you cannot believe

561
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,840
right the parents never paid any

562
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,308
attention to them or maybe just punished

563
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,829
them every time they did something good

564
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:44,119
that's really fun and then you know they

565
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:48,829
didn't make friends and so they're

566
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:50,479
really really big and and and poorly

567
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,220
articulated and so then what you do is

568
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,769
you work at the bottom of the micro

569
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,150
routines and get them to practice

570
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:57,889
building up all these little attributes

571
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,419
that they didn't build up and you know

572
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,429
one of the things you can think about in

573
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,900
terms of character development is so now

574
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,490
maybe understand something about your

575
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,110
own personality you might say well what

576
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,808
could you do to improve your personality

577
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:10,759
and the answer is develop some of the

578
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,918
micro routines on the other side of the

579
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,658
personality distribution so if you're

580
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,099
disagreeable as hell maybe

581
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:18,470
start learning how to do nice things for

582
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:20,028
people and that actually works by the

583
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,589
way so if you take disagreeable people

584
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:22,848
who are depressed and you get them doing

585
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,709
nice things for other people their

586
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,168
depression tends to lift but then by the

587
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,450
same token if you're agreeable then you

588
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,249
should practice doing some things for

589
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,319
yourself and being more tough minded in

590
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:35,329
your negotiations and so you can sort of

591
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,278
place yourself on the on the personality

592
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:39,589
trait distribution you know you're

593
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,720
extrovert it's like okay man learn to

594
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:43,759
spend some time with yourself right

595
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,470
you're low in openness well try reading

596
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,239
a book that's outside of your you know

597
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,450
your your sphere of interest now and

598
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:51,700
then if you're conscientious well you

599
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,080
should probably learn how to relax

600
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,729
occasionally and and so forth so you can

601
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,108
I think partly what you're doing is

602
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:59,389
you're developing your personality is

603
00:20:57,108 --> 00:21:01,368
not moving the mean much the average

604
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:03,618
where you know where you're located but

605
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:05,118
you're extending the standard deviation

606
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:07,548
so that you're a bigger bag of tricks

607
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:09,439
than you were before and I think you can

608
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:12,378
practice that consciously it's like

609
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,989
you're hyper orderly it's well get a dog

610
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:16,339
you know dogs they're messy horrible

611
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,659
things you know it's just what you need

612
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,038
if you're hyper orderly because they're

613
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,859
gonna leave hair everywhere and force

614
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,598
you live with it and so okay so and so

615
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:26,210
this is sort of you right this is your

616
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:28,519
personality it's this connect collection

617
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,229
of root subroutines that you've turned

618
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,638
into a hierarchy and then there's

619
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:33,379
something at the top of it and that's

620
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,699
that's a big question like what the hell

621
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,288
should be at the top of the hierarchy

622
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,659
because that's the ultimate question of

623
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:40,460
unity and then the clinicians would say

624
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:42,440
well it's the self-actualized person or

625
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,999
it's the self or something like that you

626
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,700
know that's that's the ID that's the

627
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,009
implicit and perhaps explicit ideal that

628
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,379
you're aiming for and you might say well

629
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,108
is does such thing exists that I would

630
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:56,298
say well do you admire people because

631
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:58,788
that's your answer right do you despise

632
00:21:56,298 --> 00:22:00,229
people well you like some people and you

633
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:02,118
don't like others you respect some

634
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:04,009
people you don't respect others well

635
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:06,138
you're acting out the notion that

636
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:07,608
there's at least an implicit ideal you

637
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:09,288
do the same thing when you go to movies

638
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:11,028
you know you you know who the hero is

639
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,739
you know who the bad guy is you're

640
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:14,358
acting out the proposition that there's

641
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:16,190
some sort of value hierarchy and there's

642
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,749
some sort of manifestation of it that's

643
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,879
coherent across time

644
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:21,470
so you appear to believe that and you

645
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:24,019
know you are driven at least to some

646
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,229
degree by your own inner ideals and so

647
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,089
you tend to answer the question is that

648
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:31,278
real with an affirmed

649
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:32,538
and if you don't there's catastrophic

650
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,710
consequences Nietzsche and the

651
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:35,329
existentialist we're very good at

652
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,720
detailing that's like you let your value

653
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:40,849
hierarchy disintegrate well then what

654
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,159
well part of it is nihilistic chaos whoo

655
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:45,349
that's not so much fun and then there's

656
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,360
the alignment of nihilistic chaos with

657
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:49,668
the intrinsic desire that someone will

658
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,168
come along and tell you what to do right

659
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:53,090
so what happens is if you let this

660
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,659
devolve you end up with nihilistic

661
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,638
exists

662
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,830
not with nihilistic chaos or the demand

663
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:59,808
for for the tyrant to come forward and

664
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:04,089
we've had that happen lots of times and

665
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:04,089
doesn't seem to have gone that well so

666
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:09,618
all right well so what happens when you

667
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,528
you lay out these little routines in the

668
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:14,480
world at different levels of analysis

669
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:16,970
well this is how your emotions function

670
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,999
broadly speaking you know you're aiming

671
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,589
at something and this is an

672
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,118
oversimplification which is why I want

673
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:27,849
to show you this right when I show you

674
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:30,069
this assume that it's made out of that

675
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:33,408
right it's just a schematic

676
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:35,118
oversimplification because even if let's

677
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,129
say that I'm trying to do something as

678
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:40,699
simple as walking towards the door I

679
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:42,528
mean that the action of walking towards

680
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,110
the door is predicated on the existence

681
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:48,679
of all the subroutines that enable me to

682
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:51,229
propel my body across time and space and

683
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,450
like there's that took a lot of internal

684
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,579
organization to get that right it's a

685
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,399
traumatized now and so you can treat it

686
00:23:55,579 --> 00:24:00,288
like it's invisible but implicit in any

687
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:02,538
one of these structures is this entire

688
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:04,548
structure and you actually see this in

689
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:07,190
therapy very frequently too so I was

690
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,990
talking to a client the other day it was

691
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,330
so interesting this person said

692
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,940
something he had been talking to his

693
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:16,220
mother and he's he just made a casual

694
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,990
comment he said he was talking to his

695
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,429
mother who was in a state of grief for

696
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,740
for good reasons that were it

697
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:27,499
independent of this particular person

698
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:28,849
who said and I hate her and I thought oh

699
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,159
that's interesting like where did that

700
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:31,548
come from and so I made a comment on

701
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,710
that

702
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:35,509
that's a Freudian slip right because

703
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,409
there was the conversation was flowing

704
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:40,909
and then this little emotion tagged

705
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,590
utterance came forward and whenever an

706
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:45,230
emotion tagged utterance

707
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:47,240
of that sort comes forward you know it's

708
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,740
associated with a whole rat's nest of

709
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,599
underlying pain and anxiety and and and

710
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,128
on what would you call it disappointment

711
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,259
and frustration that hasn't been

712
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:58,939
properly rectified so it's like a marker

713
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,349
and yet you know this when you're

714
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,360
talking to people they say something and

715
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:04,369
you think oh you know what Wow

716
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,048
too much information that's one way of

717
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,699
thinking about it's like just what are

718
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,288
you up to and and then if you have any

719
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,850
sense you just forget that that even

720
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:12,769
happened and you continue but that's

721
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:15,199
that's like the snout of a dragon

722
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:17,659
peeking out from a cave and you might

723
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,730
say well it's just a snout man but it's

724
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,919
not because dragons snouts tend to be

725
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,240
attached to the whole damn dragon and so

726
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,889
this is also something to know about

727
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,419
relationships because when you're in a

728
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:28,638
relationship with someone they'll do

729
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,679
that now and then they'll you know utter

730
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:32,479
something and you think huh-huh it's

731
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,070
like there's a bump in the road well

732
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,679
we're gonna look underneath that at our

733
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:38,480
peril but if you do go down there and

734
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,119
you look at it then then the whole thing

735
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,710
comes you can start to disentangle the

736
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:46,490
the web of of memories and and

737
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,019
experiences that are all tangled

738
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,240
together as a consequence of their

739
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:51,558
emotional identity because I could say

740
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,599
well everything that makes you anxious

741
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:55,700
or everything that makes you upset is

742
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,189
the same as every other thing that's

743
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,230
ever made you upset and so and then

744
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,788
there's an even different subset instead

745
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,079
of that which is all those things that

746
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:05,028
have made you upset that you've never

747
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,949
dealt with they're all laying down there

748
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:09,019
at the bottom of your nasty little soul

749
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,690
waiting to pop themselves up in some in

750
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,940
some random utterance right and so then

751
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,320
you go in there at your peril because if

752
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,940
you're the person who pokes around in

753
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,009
that then you're gonna get blasted with

754
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,769
all of that stuff it's gonna come out

755
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:24,079
like almost uncontrollably then then you

756
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,700
can sort it out and so what you find is

757
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,470
if you ask a person a question like that

758
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,110
and then you let them free associate

759
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,629
which is just talk about it they'll do a

760
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:34,248
wandering around like that maze that I

761
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:36,709
told you about they'll do a wandering

762
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:38,839
around of that entire territory and

763
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,850
sometimes just having them worn during

764
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,408
it can help them straighten it out but

765
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,658
you might find out that something

766
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,610
happened to them 15 years ago that left

767
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:49,220
them with a terrible sense of guilt or

768
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:50,658
dismay or frustration and then when when

769
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,220
they interact with their parents in a

770
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,080
certain way the parent knows exactly how

771
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,909
to tap that and then that all comes up

772
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,329
and that's what produces that that

773
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:58,460
little

774
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:00,799
that little utterance and so that's the

775
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,569
material of the world manifesting itself

776
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,879
that's what matters

777
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:07,309
manifesting itself and it almost always

778
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,560
manifests itself as an object something

779
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:12,139
that objects we're having a conversation

780
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,599
it's going quite well no problem there's

781
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,430
a bump in it there's an emotional

782
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,139
disjunct right now we're no longer in

783
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,299
the same place at the same time we're no

784
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,890
longer playing the same game so that I

785
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:23,149
might say okay well let's open that up

786
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,730
and see what's behind it

787
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:28,160
well the question is what's behind the

788
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,380
game you're playing and the answer to

789
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,390
that is all the world that you're

790
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:39,230
ignoring always so when so when imagine

791
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,050
that think about it this way you're

792
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:45,349
trying to do well in a class and you get

793
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,669
a bad grade okay so you're in this

794
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:48,289
little frame you want to get a good

795
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,289
grade that isn't happening you got a bad

796
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:54,079
grade okay what is it that's manifesting

797
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:55,849
itself as the bad grade well you could

798
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,589
say well it's a c-minus on a piece of

799
00:27:55,849 --> 00:28:00,500
paper it's like well that's you know

800
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:02,659
really no that's the objective

801
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,970
manifestation you got a piece of paper

802
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,230
with a c-minus the value-free

803
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,000
proposition is that you've been

804
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,860
delivered a piece of paper with a curve

805
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,829
on it a little you know negative sign

806
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:15,679
well you think well that's what that is

807
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,299
well you know it's as dopey as thinking

808
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,070
well here you got your failing grade you

809
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,500
go into the lab and you like weigh it on

810
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:23,029
a scale then you burn it and see what it

811
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,309
was made of it's like well why did I get

812
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:29,750
so upset about that it's just paper it's

813
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:31,129
like no that's not just paper it's an

814
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,589
entity that exists in a web of

815
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,150
connections the fact that it's signified

816
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:38,149
by paper is almost completely irrelevant

817
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,490
what is it the answer is you don't know

818
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,040
and that's why when you pick it up you

819
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,019
get this paralyzed sinking feeling

820
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,420
because your limbic system is a lot

821
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:49,460
smarter than your perceptual systems and

822
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,110
your perceptual systems say well that's

823
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:56,329
a piece of paper and your limbic system

824
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:58,279
says nah for sure dragan right right and

825
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:59,929
so then you're sweating and then maybe

826
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,629
you put it away and you go play video

827
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,789
games because you know better the

828
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,520
hypothetical dragon than the real dragon

829
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:10,069
and so instead you pull out the piece of

830
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,549
paper maybe and you think okay why

831
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:15,159
I did I get this c-minus well that's a

832
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:18,559
hell of a question isn't it it's like

833
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,269
maybe you're stupid well that could be

834
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,799
or at least stupid compared to who you

835
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:23,450
think you are like that's that's the

836
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,740
real horror that's lurking there writes

837
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,529
like all I thought it was kind of smart

838
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,309
that's a that's a proposition of the

839
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:30,589
highest order

840
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,329
I thought I was kind of smart it's like

841
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:35,539
yeah well what about this c-minus it's

842
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:38,269
like well that goddamn professor right

843
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:40,159
that's the first thing it's it's I've

844
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:42,019
been attacked by a predator that's the

845
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,970
first response right so it's it's a

846
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,799
nonsensical message it's just delivered

847
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:49,640
by someone evil and predatory well

848
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,349
that's you know possible but I wouldn't

849
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,860
go there I wouldn't go there first

850
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:56,509
necessarily so but then well then say

851
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,719
you don't go there okay well so what is

852
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:01,759
this exactly do you not know what you

853
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,589
thought you know are you not who you

854
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,079
think you are do you not work hard

855
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:08,569
enough or your values not organized

856
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,509
properly do you misuse your time are you

857
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:12,859
in the wrong field is the way you're

858
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,569
construing your life completely

859
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:16,099
inappropriate are you acting out what

860
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:17,389
your parents wanted you to do it and

861
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:19,819
you're pissed off about it so you're

862
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,280
only running at 40% despite them despite

863
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:23,990
the fact that they're paying $25,000 a

864
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,480
year for your education because that's a

865
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:29,210
fun game yeah I'll go do what you want

866
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,980
me to do but I'll fail but not

867
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,509
completely because then that would

868
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,269
wouldn't cost you very much I'll just

869
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:37,009
fail a little bit so that you have to

870
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,660
spend all that money forcing me to do

871
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:40,519
what I don't want to do but you'll never

872
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,320
get to escape from it and then every

873
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,579
time we interact I'll stab you in

874
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,679
various ways that you don't quite

875
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,419
understand just to show you how

876
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,009
irritated I am that I happen to be

877
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,230
acting out the destiny that you've put

878
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:53,240
forward for me so maybe that's part of

879
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,759
the dragon' right and then that pulls in

880
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,700
the whole parent thing and you know it's

881
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,470
these are bottomless pits often when you

882
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,330
when you're in the world there's

883
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,690
something objects to you something that

884
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:08,119
matters objects to you then in the

885
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,860
entire unrealized world is in that thing

886
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,869
that objects it's all tangled up inside

887
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:14,119
that's why it's the great dragon of

888
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:16,369
chaos it's everything that's outside of

889
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,439
your conceptual structure and what is

890
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:21,439
that it's everything that lurks outside

891
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,330
of your of your walled city and it's

892
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,049
manifested itself like the snake in the

893
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:26,089
garden and the

894
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,470
easiest thing to do is say I'm not

895
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,769
having anything to do with that but the

896
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,539
problem with that is well you get your

897
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,799
c- and you don't do anything about it

898
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,629
maybe you're a little bitter and more

899
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,980
resentful in your study habits get a

900
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,770
little worse so the next time you get

901
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,269
like a d-plus and then you collect a

902
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:44,029
bunch of FS and then you stop going to

903
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:45,740
school then you stop showering right

904
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:48,019
then you end up jumping off the bridge

905
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,579
and so that's a that's that's how the

906
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:51,619
dragon eats you when you don't pay

907
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:53,929
attention to it and so it's no bloody

908
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:56,149
wonder that people avoid you know it's

909
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,299
really no wonder that they avoid because

910
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:02,350
error messages contain within them the

911
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:04,369
implicit world now the upside of that is

912
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:06,799
while they contain within them the

913
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:08,659
implicit world and the world isn't all

914
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,099
negative and so maybe you get your

915
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,630
c-minus and that's actually the best

916
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:14,779
gift you ever got because somebody

917
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:17,570
finally took you and went whack you no

918
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:18,950
clue in and so you take that apart and

919
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:21,079
you think oh I don't know how to write I

920
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,210
don't know how to think I've never read

921
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:25,039
anything in my life my study habits are

922
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,650
abysmal you know like maybe I'm working

923
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,389
at 2% efficiency which which is probably

924
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,220
I would suspect that you know some of

925
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,950
you aren't doing that but I bet you that

926
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,480
I bet there's thirty thirty to fifty

927
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,549
percent of the people in the room are

928
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,559
working at two percent efficiency it's

929
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,359
like you got it that's so to find that

930
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,399
out is so optimistic I mean if you're

931
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,439
barely hanging in there but you're only

932
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,150
working out 2% you might imagine what

933
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,660
you could have as a life if you work it

934
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:52,700
out like 50 percent so so that the

935
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,740
c-minus can be the best gift you ever

936
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,330
had and that's the gold that the Dragon

937
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,440
hoards right that's exactly what that

938
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:02,329
means and so well so you're moving from

939
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,680
point A to point B in your little

940
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,809
circumscribed world you've made

941
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,820
everything invisible and as long as that

942
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:09,409
works then your Theory's good enough

943
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,569
it's accurate enough it's true enough

944
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,420
you're in your little paradise but if

945
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:16,129
something comes up and objects well

946
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,500
that's where your character is tested

947
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,300
fundamentally that's the character test

948
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,180
it's like what do you do with messages

949
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:26,809
of error and that's a tricky issue okay

950
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,420
so here's a solution to that here's what

951
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,159
not to do I am a bad person

952
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,509
I got to see mice I'm a bad person I'm

953
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,460
out I'll just go jump off the bridge

954
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,460
it's like no that's not good because

955
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,910
what that means is that every time every

956
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,779
time you try to

957
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,370
learn something you're going to make a

958
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,990
mistake because what do you know so

959
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:43,309
you're gonna make mistakes and if the

960
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,380
rule is every time you make a mistake

961
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,079
you're gonna go jump off the bridge then

962
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,600
that's not a useful problem-solving

963
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,939
strategy and so when you make a mistake

964
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:55,730
you don't get to beat yourself to death

965
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,140
with a club it's a bad strategy and

966
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,150
you'll have your internal tyrant in

967
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,490
there who's perfectly happy about doing

968
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,800
that that's the you know overactive

969
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,380
super-ego that Freud talked about maybe

970
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,750
it came to you via a parent who was too

971
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,220
authoritarian or a grandparent or or

972
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,320
maybe it's just you because you're

973
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,969
disagreeable and neurotic and so you'll

974
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,150
take you're at hyper conscientious

975
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:20,659
you'll take yourself apart well starting

976
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:23,780
the and so you've got a problem

977
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:25,399
something has objected to you then the

978
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,810
question is well what does that mean

979
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,760
well maybe you're not looking at the

980
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:30,799
world right maybe your goals are wrong

981
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,440
maybe you're not acting properly it's

982
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,910
okay so the question that arises when an

983
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:41,329
obstacle emerges is which part of this

984
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:45,019
structure needs attention and the first

985
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,579
answer can't be all of it which is why

986
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:48,739
when you're arguing with someone in an

987
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:51,168
intimate relationship and you're angry

988
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,829
at them and you want to win which is a

989
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:56,150
big mistake

990
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:57,440
you want to win you say well your this

991
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,820
is what you're like here's another ten

992
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,220
examples of how you've done that in the

993
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,990
past and I can enumerate more of them if

994
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:04,819
you'd like and so it doesn't that's

995
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:06,229
actually what you like and I've tried

996
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,370
fixing you and didn't work and so it

997
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,630
looks like you're gonna be like that up

998
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,670
into the future and you're basically

999
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,289
saying to them well you're a bad person

1000
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,289
and the only thing they can do is either

1001
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:17,210
collapse or punch you and punching you

1002
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:18,259
is actually better than collapsing look

1003
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,030
you don't you know what I mean it's such

1004
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,740
a counterproductive way of arguing they

1005
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,290
you don't leave the person any out and

1006
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:26,389
so maybe while they're civilized so it

1007
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,009
doesn't get physical well maybe that's

1008
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:29,839
good and maybe it isn't but then they

1009
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,550
end up either really not happy with you

1010
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,710
in a way that they will manifest the

1011
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,970
first possible opportunity they get or

1012
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,190
they have to go off in the corner and

1013
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:39,319
cringe it's like great you won it's like

1014
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,909
now your partners either hates you or is

1015
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,430
cringing it's great that's a real good

1016
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:44,929
victory man cry rack up about a hundred

1017
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:46,849
victories like that and you'll be in

1018
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:48,799
divorce court and spending two hundred

1019
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,509
and fifty thousand dollars while being

1020
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,750
miserable about it

1021
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,310
yeah so anyway so something objects to

1022
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,070
you and you think okay well I need to I

1023
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:59,690
need to take myself apart right because

1024
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,039
there's a piece that's broken somewhere

1025
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,170
and then you might think well let's

1026
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,269
let's assume it's a little piece to

1027
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,139
begin with that's the right mechanism

1028
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:11,809
it's like okay you got a c-minus that

1029
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:13,730
doesn't prove that you're stupid and now

1030
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,289
it implies that you might be stupid but

1031
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,309
it doesn't right really it does and

1032
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,659
that's why you don't want to look at it

1033
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,670
maybe it implies that you're lazier

1034
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:21,440
implies that you're ignorant or like it

1035
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,840
implies all sorts of terrible might

1036
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,130
imply that you're a bad person even but

1037
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,050
you don't want to leap to that and

1038
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,170
that's sort of the proclamation of

1039
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,990
innocence before guilt assume that

1040
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,570
you're the least amount of reprehensible

1041
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:37,099
and ignorant possible and so then you

1042
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,350
look at the micro routines it's okay

1043
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,230
well I got a c-minus in this course

1044
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:44,989
maybe I should study for that course

1045
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,210
fifteen minutes more a day for the next

1046
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,919
three months and then you ask yourself

1047
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,929
do you think you could do that no I'm

1048
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,579
too useless okay how about fifteen

1049
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:53,868
minutes every second day you think you

1050
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,940
could do that you put it in your

1051
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:58,430
schedule like 15 minutes every second

1052
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,690
day in the morning and that's while you

1053
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:02,509
think well what's wrong with me

1054
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,550
well I'm not very good at managing my

1055
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,050
study schedule that's not quite down

1056
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,060
here at the behavioral level but it's

1057
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,619
pretty close because what you you can

1058
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,599
take an action you can open up your

1059
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:13,430
schedule and you can say all mark 50

1060
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,900
minutes of it aside then you can

1061
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:16,879
practice doing that it's pretty low

1062
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,769
level in the hierarchy means while

1063
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,170
you're still not a horrible person you

1064
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:23,090
just gotta polish up your work ethic and

1065
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,820
so what you want to do is you want to

1066
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,260
it's like it's like the old adage you

1067
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,789
got to stand up for yourself but you

1068
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,040
don't want to make unnecessary enemies

1069
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,719
that's a really good thing to know it's

1070
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,759
like shut the hell up most of the time

1071
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,199
but now and then you don't shut up

1072
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,670
because it's time to say something you

1073
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,589
don't you don't want to make unnecessary

1074
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,240
enemies though well you don't want to

1075
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,760
take yourself apart any more than is

1076
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,989
absolutely necessary

1077
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,550
start little and you do that with people

1078
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:48,169
around you too like if you have a child

1079
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,090
you know and the child does something

1080
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,519
that isn't right

1081
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,559
then you think okay minimal necessary

1082
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,239
intervention what can we do to decrease

1083
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,539
the probability that that's going to

1084
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,559
occur in the future so and that's so

1085
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:02,300
that's a good thing to know with

1086
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,980
children it's also a good thing to know

1087
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,140
with your partners you have an argument

1088
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,480
some it's like okay what the hell do you

1089
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:10,309
want what's the minimum thing you can

1090
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,409
request from them that would satisfy you

1091
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:14,539
and the evil part of your soul is going

1092
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:17,118
to be I want them cringing in a corner

1093
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:19,159
it's like yeah get that get that stuff

1094
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,990
under control man see if you can figure

1095
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:22,579
out what that person could offer you

1096
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,919
that would be minimal that you would

1097
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,989
accept and then tell them that it's like

1098
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,280
here's the words I would like you to say

1099
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:29,809
in the apology I would like you to

1100
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,490
formulate assuming that you think you

1101
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,679
did something wrong we have to argue

1102
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:35,089
about that because maybe you didn't but

1103
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,250
if you did I want to specify it

1104
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,769
precisely and narrowly and I want to

1105
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,510
give you an escape route and you know

1106
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,130
you might only be able to do it badly

1107
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,900
because you're still mad so you

1108
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,090
apologize half-heartedly it's like you

1109
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,470
get a pat on the head for that good next

1110
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:53,780
time it'll be 51% not half-heartedly

1111
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:55,459
right so it's careful training its

1112
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,619
careful training of yourself and other

1113
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,010
people with with the goal in mind but

1114
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:02,539
also with the least amount of harshness

1115
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,520
possible and then the other thing to do

1116
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:05,659
as well and this is also true for you

1117
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,059
and this is something I learned from

1118
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:09,739
studying the behavior is like watch the

1119
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,659
people around you like a hawk whenever

1120
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:15,108
they do something that you think is good

1121
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:17,118
you tell them that's wisdom man you'll

1122
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:19,429
get so far with that you cannot bloody

1123
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,850
well believe it because most people you

1124
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:24,049
know they're afraid of any number of

1125
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:25,460
things but one of the things they're

1126
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,260
really afraid of is that now and then

1127
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,940
they'll creep out of their cynical shell

1128
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,140
and try to do something good you know

1129
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,880
it's like they're it's like they're

1130
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:34,460
popping out this thing that's

1131
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,760
unbelievably vulnerable to try to do

1132
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,769
something good and creep right back into

1133
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,869
their persona and they'll look around

1134
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:43,130
see if anyone noticed and sometimes

1135
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:44,600
they'll get punished for it and then

1136
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,450
well then they won't do it again so

1137
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,799
don't do that but then now and then you

1138
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,089
think hey I saw you do this it was

1139
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,590
actually that was actually pretty good

1140
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:57,380
Oh someone noticed it looks like wow and

1141
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,539
then they'll think yeah I could maybe I

1142
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,460
like I could do that again and if you

1143
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:03,679
want to live with someone for a long

1144
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,119
period of time I would say every time

1145
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,118
they do something that you would like

1146
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,780
them to do more of number one notice

1147
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,970
number two tell them right because I

1148
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,890
know you don't want to because you

1149
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,419
really want to dominate them and you

1150
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,929
don't you don't want them thriving

1151
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,059
because then

1152
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:21,348
maybe a they'd be competition to you and

1153
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,490
you wouldn't be able to go complain to

1154
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:24,200
your mother about what a miserable

1155
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,328
partner you have and you know how

1156
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,189
delightful that is so you have to forego

1157
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,200
all that pleasure if you actually help

1158
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,358
your person develop so you got to get

1159
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,039
over all that it's really annoying so

1160
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:35,598
you know you've got this person peg this

1161
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,159
yeah you're stuck with them and you know

1162
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,140
maybe it's the best you can do but you

1163
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:40,519
got one eye open and then every time

1164
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:42,588
they do something good you don't want to

1165
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,639
notice because if that elevated them a

1166
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:45,409
little bit you wouldn't be able to feel

1167
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,210
so resentful and miserable and keep your

1168
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:50,239
eye open for the next possible affair

1169
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,588
and that is what people are like that is

1170
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,179
what people are like and that's what

1171
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:55,338
you're like - that's what people are

1172
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:57,558
like so you got to decide if that's what

1173
00:40:55,338 --> 00:41:00,889
you want or you want to help the person

1174
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,359
that you're with grow you know that's

1175
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:05,088
dangerous because they might out sign

1176
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,039
you well good then you have someone to

1177
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,900
compare yourself to that would be a good

1178
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,130
deal it's really rough with kids you

1179
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,500
know because parents will stop their

1180
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,829
children from succeeding beyond them

1181
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,809
they get jealous and then they'll put

1182
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:20,390
them down and then they have kids that

1183
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:24,109
do not like them and they'll pay for it

1184
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:25,699
so one of the things that I figured out

1185
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:28,159
over the last years is this is a good

1186
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:31,068
proposition so you know it's pretty

1187
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,838
self-evident that life is has got its

1188
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:34,068
rat's nest of miseries and that's for

1189
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:35,808
sure and maybe you could even make a

1190
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:38,150
categorical statement that life is

1191
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:39,140
mostly a rat's nest of misery you know

1192
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,930
and you can make a pretty powerful

1193
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:43,400
argument for that but then there's a

1194
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:44,659
counter question which is well what if

1195
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,660
you tried not to make it any more

1196
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:50,239
miserable that had had to be right then

1197
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:52,308
what then what would it be like and my

1198
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,439
suspicions are is that a lot of that

1199
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,609
misery I would suspect that most of that

1200
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,409
misery would go away

1201
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:58,848
because it's the unnecessary misery that

1202
00:41:57,409 --> 00:42:00,980
really brings you down you know it's

1203
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:05,059
like well someone has cancer it's like

1204
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:08,240
that sucks but it's not like it's not

1205
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:10,130
like you can say if only we had done

1206
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,259
this differently then that wouldn't have

1207
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,240
happened but when someone's out like

1208
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,470
torturing you in a malevolent way or

1209
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,328
maybe you're doing the same you could

1210
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:19,189
always ask yourself was it really it's

1211
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:21,589
this really necessary is this just like

1212
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,599
an useless add-on to the miseries of

1213
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:26,798
life that's what disheartens people and

1214
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,660
so even in your own life if if you if

1215
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:31,550
you aren't suffering from self-imposed

1216
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,409
misery and your

1217
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,660
only suffering from an escapable misery

1218
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:37,759
maybe you could handle that and you know

1219
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:40,539
you could you could survive you could

1220
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,130
bear it and even maybe without becoming

1221
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:45,110
irredeemably corrupt so the goal would

1222
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,090
be well yeah life is a rat's nest of

1223
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,309
miseries and maybe it has no ultimate

1224
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,260
meaning we could say that for feeling

1225
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:53,269
particularly pessimistic but it still

1226
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,470
leaves one question open which is if you

1227
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:57,559
didn't do everything you could to make

1228
00:42:54,469 --> 00:43:00,649
it worse how good could you make it be

1229
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:04,009
and the least answer is well it it could

1230
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,539
be tragedy but maybe not hell and I

1231
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,890
think that's right I really believe that

1232
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:09,619
that's that's the most pessimistic

1233
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,989
proper statement the worst-case outcome

1234
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,670
in the worst of all possible worlds is

1235
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,549
that your life could be tragic but not

1236
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,590
hell and that's blood better than hell

1237
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,820
right it's it's and you think I could

1238
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,559
give you an example of the difference

1239
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,050
you're at your mother's deathbed

1240
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,029
well that's tragedy here's another

1241
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,769
scenario you're at your mother's

1242
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,920
deathbed and all you you and all your

1243
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:32,509
idiot siblings are arguing well that's

1244
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,400
the difference between tragedy and hell

1245
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,810
and you might be able to tolerate the

1246
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,309
first circumstance and maybe it would

1247
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:40,309
even bring you closer together with your

1248
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:41,960
family members the second one no one can

1249
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:44,750
bear that you walk away from a situation

1250
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,579
like that sick of yourself and sick of

1251
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,590
everything else - and you know it's

1252
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:52,250
often the case that tragic circumstances

1253
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,780
bring out the Dragons because the stress

1254
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,539
is high and all those things that people

1255
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,640
haven't dealt with they don't have the

1256
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:00,800
energy to repress and and all the

1257
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,379
bitterness comes pouring forward it's

1258
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,430
like seriously man you know so that's

1259
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,960
actually a good

1260
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:07,579
it's a rough lesson but it's a good

1261
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,039
hallmark for figuring out whether or not

1262
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:12,110
you're you've got yourself adjusted

1263
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:14,300
properly and in relationship to your

1264
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,099
siblings it's like if you are all

1265
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,820
gathered around the bed of someone close

1266
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:21,739
who is dying could you manage it if the

1267
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,180
answer is no it's like well put your

1268
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:25,189
life together because it's going to

1269
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:27,079
happen and you should be the person

1270
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,000
who's there that can do it and do it

1271
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,590
properly and then maybe you'd find that

1272
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,230
it isn't the sort of thing that will

1273
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:35,300
undermine your faith in life itself and

1274
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,659
I've seen I've seen both of those

1275
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:41,630
situations you know ugly ugly ugly

1276
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:43,309
situations you know murderously ugly

1277
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,579
situations and then they're opposite

1278
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:46,529
where people

1279
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,059
had terrible things happening to happen

1280
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,269
to them as a family and you know they

1281
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:53,549
pull together and they rebuild their

1282
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:57,690
damn ship and they sail away so that

1283
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:59,430
seems to me to be a lot better that

1284
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,460
makes you know when the flood comes

1285
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:04,319
right well okay so the same thing the

1286
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,539
question emerges well who are you well

1287
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:11,490
you could say your this plan that's what

1288
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:13,349
people usually that's how people usually

1289
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:15,000
identify maybe they have no plan at all

1290
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,159
and they're just in chaos right that's

1291
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,750
like being in the belly of the beast

1292
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:20,940
they're nihilistic and chaos they have

1293
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,469
no plan they're just chaos itself and

1294
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,780
that's a very dreadful situation for

1295
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:26,909
people to be in or maybe they conjure

1296
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,230
together a plan that's their identity

1297
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:29,879
it's kind of fragile and they're holding

1298
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,409
on to that with with everything they've

1299
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,090
got it's their little stick of wood that

1300
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:35,099
they're floating in the ocean clinging

1301
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,500
to you know and so they're identifying

1302
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,000
really hard with that plan that's what

1303
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,619
happens when you're an ideologue is that

1304
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,079
you're identifying really hard with that

1305
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,299
plan the problem is if something comes

1306
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,710
up to confront it well how do you act

1307
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,890
well you can't let go with a plan

1308
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,659
because you drown then you cling to it

1309
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,909
rigidly well that's no good because then

1310
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:55,529
you can't learn anything then if that's

1311
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:57,029
you you're a totalitarian you're not

1312
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,980
going to learn anything you're gonna end

1313
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,880
up in something that's close enough to

1314
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,230
hell so that you won't know the

1315
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,150
difference and you might drag everyone

1316
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,829
along with you that's happened plenty of

1317
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,599
times right it's the whole story of the

1318
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:09,059
20th century happened over and over and

1319
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,549
over and it happens in people's States

1320
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,469
it happens in their business

1321
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,720
organizations it happens in their cities

1322
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:17,759
it happens in their provinces it happens

1323
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:20,759
in their states and it happens in their

1324
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,340
psyches all at the same time you can't

1325
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,930
blame the manifestation of that sort of

1326
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,300
thing on any of those one levels it

1327
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:29,460
happens when a society goes down that

1328
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,650
way it goes down everywhere at the same

1329
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,570
time it's not the totalitarians at the

1330
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,639
top and all the happy people striving to

1331
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,440
be free at the bottom it's not that at

1332
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,359
all it's totalitarianism at every single

1333
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,340
level of the hierarchy including the

1334
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,570
psychological and so you don't want to

1335
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,220
be the thing you don't want to be in

1336
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,360
chaos that's for sure but you don't want

1337
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:47,819
to be the thing that clings so

1338
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,370
desperately to the raft that you can't

1339
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,370
let go when someone comes to rescue you

1340
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:55,049
right you don't want to be that so then

1341
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:58,529
you think well exactly what are you

1342
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,570
you know what the chaos you not the plan

1343
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:03,269
maybe you're the thing that confronts

1344
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:07,080
the obstacle and I would say that's the

1345
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:09,389
categorical lesson of of psychology

1346
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,219
insofar as it has to do with personal

1347
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:12,719
transformation that's what you always

1348
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,980
teach people in psychotherapy I don't

1349
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,239
care what sort of psychotherapists you

1350
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,820
are you're always teaching them the same

1351
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:20,159
thing you're the thing that can you not

1352
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,840
you're not the plan you're the thing

1353
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,000
that can confront the obstacle to the

1354
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,440
plan and then when you know even further

1355
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,469
that the obstacle is not only an

1356
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,730
obstacle but opportunity itself well

1357
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:31,019
then your whole view of the world can

1358
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,579
change because you might think well I've

1359
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,550
got this plan something came up to

1360
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:37,049
object to it it's like it's possible

1361
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,490
that the thing that's objecting has

1362
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,019
something to teach you that will take

1363
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:42,449
you to the place where you develop an

1364
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:44,219
even better plan that's a nice framework

1365
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:46,739
to use it's like are you so sure that

1366
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,659
this is a problem is that the only way

1367
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,909
that you can look at it or is it an

1368
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:53,219
opportunity I mean I'm not trying to be

1369
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,569
you know naively optimistic there are

1370
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,639
some things that's pretty hard to

1371
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,140
extract gold from some dragons and maybe

1372
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,858
the death of a family member is a good

1373
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,868
example of that

1374
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:02,608
but in even in a situation like that I

1375
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,760
can tell you that it's an opportunity

1376
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:06,630
for it's an opportunity for maturation

1377
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,390
that's for sure

1378
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,550
and the thing is you might say well it's

1379
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:13,170
pretty miserable to go to be digging for

1380
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,359
gold when someone's falling into the

1381
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,559
grave well if they really love you first

1382
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,539
of all that's what they'll want you to

1383
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,829
do and second you're gonna make their

1384
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,440
death a lot more palatable experience

1385
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:24,059
for them if you're someone who can be in

1386
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,530
the room and be helpful instead of be

1387
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:26,880
you know quivering in the corner and

1388
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,530
feeling that the entire world is

1389
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,510
collapsing in on you I mean that's

1390
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,060
another you want to be the useful person

1391
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:35,820
at the funeral how's that for a goal

1392
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,259
that's a good goal man you know that

1393
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,910
you've got yourself together in a

1394
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,980
situation like that because you're gonna

1395
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:43,319
be at them and maybe you want to be the

1396
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,900
person on whose shoulder people cry

1397
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,640
that'd be a good goal that's kind of you

1398
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,139
know I don't like being naively

1399
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,608
optimistic so when I tell you to get

1400
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:53,699
your life together I'm not gonna say

1401
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:56,489
roses and sunshine it's like that's

1402
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:59,159
that's that's that's pablum for fools

1403
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:01,979
but it really is something to be the

1404
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,259
reliable person out of funeral right and

1405
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,608
you can aim at that you can do that it's

1406
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,900
and you got to be tough to do that

1407
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:11,279
because it also means that you can

1408
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,940
sustain a major loss without collapsing

1409
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,470
and that

1410
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,849
you've got to be a monster to do that

1411
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:17,719
right because you might think and I've

1412
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:21,269
had clients like this while I love my

1413
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:23,039
child I love my mother so much that I

1414
00:49:21,269 --> 00:49:25,949
couldn't survive if anything happened to

1415
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,630
them it's like you have some serious

1416
00:49:25,949 --> 00:49:29,129
thinking to do about that

1417
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,110
it's like you really want to curse

1418
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,300
someone with that kind of love do you I

1419
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:36,269
couldn't live without you it's like my

1420
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:39,180
god get away from me

1421
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:42,119
really it's terrible that's the eatable

1422
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:43,619
mother right that's like I'll forgive

1423
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,589
you no matter what you do it's like

1424
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:49,469
really you no matter what I do eh

1425
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:52,380
you are not my friend that's for sure

1426
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:55,889
not at all it's a horrible thing to do

1427
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,019
to someone that's that's the witch in

1428
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:00,359
the Hansel and Gretel story all

1429
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:03,690
gingerbread and outside to the lost kid

1430
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:06,690
inside you feed them candy and make them

1431
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,429
fat and eat them right that's Hansel and

1432
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,650
Gretel that's the eatable mother that's

1433
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:12,629
one of Freud's major discoveries it gets

1434
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:15,630
a major discovery it's like the

1435
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,980
devouring force of love you want the

1436
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,720
person to be able to stand on their own

1437
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,369
and price you pay for that is that you

1438
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,829
stand on your own

1439
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:26,009
it's like good to have you around I'm

1440
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:28,079
glad you're here but if if tragedies win

1441
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,850
and if and when tragedy strikes either

1442
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,329
of us I hope that one of us is standing

1443
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:34,619
when it blows past and and that there's

1444
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,179
a harshness about that that's

1445
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:38,630
unbelievably cruel because you know you

1446
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:40,589
say well if my mother died I could live

1447
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,019
well what kind of monster are you

1448
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:45,420
exactly death of your mother doesn't do

1449
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:49,380
you in well turns out that being a

1450
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:51,599
monster is the right thing so and that's

1451
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,670
a rough thing to learn but it's

1452
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,989
necessary to learn you know because it

1453
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:57,840
also makes you you know at some point

1454
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:59,849
for example as you get older mm-hmm

1455
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,970
by the time you're in your mid-20s

1456
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:04,349
something like that you should start

1457
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:07,709
having a relationship with your parents

1458
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:10,230
that's approximately one of peers and

1459
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,329
you can tell if you have that so here's

1460
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,460
a little trick you can use so you have

1461
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:16,139
parents obviously they have friends you

1462
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,940
probably care what your parents think I

1463
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,369
would imagine do you care what their

1464
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,079
friends think of you and answer that is

1465
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,369
well not nearly as much and so then I

1466
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,139
would say well why do you care what your

1467
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,338
parents think of you then they're the

1468
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:28,078
same

1469
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:30,298
you know what I mean it's just luck of

1470
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,479
the draw that your parents are someone

1471
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:34,798
else's kids friends they don't think the

1472
00:51:33,478 --> 00:51:35,909
same way about them that you do well

1473
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:38,369
that's where you see that you have a

1474
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:39,929
projection right if by the time you're

1475
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:42,390
30 if what your parents think of you

1476
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:44,159
matters more than what say a random set

1477
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:45,748
of their friends think of you then

1478
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,058
you've still got your parents confused

1479
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:49,889
with with God that's one way of looking

1480
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,930
at it you've still got them confused

1481
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:53,458
with an archetype and you're still a

1482
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:54,899
child and you might think well it's

1483
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:56,308
pretty damn rude not to think about what

1484
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,289
your parents think of you anymore not to

1485
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:00,089
care it's like yeah it's kind of rude

1486
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:02,700
but maybe you'll be useful for them when

1487
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:04,380
they get old and that's a much better

1488
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:05,909
form of caring it's like you're going to

1489
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:09,479
be independent enough and strong enough

1490
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:11,578
and and detached enough so that when the

1491
00:52:09,478 --> 00:52:15,179
taught when the when the power dynamic

1492
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:16,979
shifts which it will that you'll be the

1493
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:18,778
person that can carry things forward

1494
00:52:16,978 --> 00:52:20,848
well you can't do a better thing for

1495
00:52:18,778 --> 00:52:24,619
them than that right that's the best of

1496
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:24,619
all possible outcomes for your parents

1497
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:35,190
well you can think about the world this

1498
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:37,769
way you can think about it as your

1499
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:39,208
orderly little plan that's a place and

1500
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:41,338
you can think about it as the place that

1501
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:43,348
things that disrupt your plan comes from

1502
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:46,440
that's another place this is a bigger

1503
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:48,180
place than this because there's an

1504
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,009
endless number of things that can

1505
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,108
disrupt your plan and only a tiny number

1506
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:54,208
of them that can you know that will help

1507
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:56,489
you work it out so part of the question

1508
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:58,259
then too is like are you the friend of

1509
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:00,509
your plan or are you the friend of the

1510
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:02,458
thing that disrupts your plan and I

1511
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:03,958
would say you should work to become the

1512
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:06,149
friend of the thing that disrupts your

1513
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:08,518
plan because there's a lot of that and

1514
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,068
then if you become the friend of the

1515
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:13,468
thing that disrupts your plan then you

1516
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:15,719
start to develop strength in proportion

1517
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:16,949
to the to the disruptive force and

1518
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:18,150
that's really what you want you want to

1519
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:21,778
be able to implement your plan obviously

1520
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:24,959
but you want to be able to take on the

1521
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:27,088
consequences of error and learn from it

1522
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,978
and then then you win constantly because

1523
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:30,900
even if something goes sideways you

1524
00:53:28,978 --> 00:53:34,798
think there's something to be derived

1525
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,619
from this that's wisdom fundamentally so

1526
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:39,809
and so those are the eternal domains

1527
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,329
right there's the domain of order

1528
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:45,980
that's a snake by the way and that's a

1529
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:48,269
domain of chaos and that's the world and

1530
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,829
maybe you're in the order and maybe

1531
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:51,509
you're in the chaos but those can flip

1532
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:53,009
on you and maybe you shouldn't be in

1533
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:56,280
either of those places maybe you should

1534
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:57,930
be right in the middle and that's where

1535
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,030
you should be as far as I can tell and I

1536
00:53:57,929 --> 00:54:02,279
think this is this is another escape

1537
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,970
from postmodern nihilism let's say

1538
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,320
that's actually a real place it's not

1539
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:10,079
metaphysical or maybe it is but it's

1540
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,730
metaphysical if metaphysics is more real

1541
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,019
than physics and you can tell when

1542
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,300
you're at that place because that's a

1543
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:16,590
maximally meaningful place and you drift

1544
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,000
in and out of it all the time in your

1545
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,370
life and when things are really bad for

1546
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,630
you you're not there hardly at all right

1547
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:24,089
because everything is overwhelming you

1548
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:26,730
or the things have become sterile but if

1549
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,110
you watch your life even over a week or

1550
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:30,420
two you'll see that now and then you're

1551
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:32,430
there I think you stand up straighter

1552
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,099
right because you're in the right place

1553
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:36,899
at the right time you think aha I got

1554
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:39,420
the forces of chaos and order properly

1555
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,860
balanced it's unstable and it'll fall

1556
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,050
apart on you but you know you can

1557
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,480
practice bringing things together

1558
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,890
continually and then you can end up so

1559
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,880
that you're there more often than not

1560
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:52,949
and then that's that's a meta place it's

1561
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,460
not a place it's a meta place and it's a

1562
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:58,439
place that you can be in all places and

1563
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,030
and it's not an illusion of any sort

1564
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,950
it's the deepest reality your nervous

1565
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,320
system is always orienting yourself your

1566
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:07,259
is always orienting you to that place

1567
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,050
always and and that's because it's a

1568
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,670
real place that's another way of

1569
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:15,360
thinking about it well that's the normal

1570
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:17,610
world with that's the garden with the

1571
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,170
snake in it and that's chaos that that's

1572
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,910
the chaos that arises when your plans

1573
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,289
collapse right that's the world in the

1574
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:23,759
underworld and so the underworld is

1575
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:25,679
always there and it's lurking beneath

1576
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,990
everything it's like the figure of the

1577
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,940
shark in the jaws poster right there you

1578
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:31,709
are swinging at the top and there's that

1579
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:35,010
terrible thing underneath that can come

1580
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:36,510
up and pull you down that's the world so

1581
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,920
you need to be able to operate here and

1582
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,720
you need to be able to operate here and

1583
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,180
when you operate here well that's when

1584
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,789
you rescue your father from the belly of

1585
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:46,409
the whale that's when you go down you

1586
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:47,610
see when you're down in chaos and you

1587
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,349
don't know what the hell's going on you

1588
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,760
have to rediscover the values that

1589
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:53,429
orient people have oriented people

1590
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,630
forever that's what you have to discover

1591
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:56,009
so for example when I'm dealing with

1592
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,869
people have post-traumatic stress

1593
00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:00,270
disorder and they've usually encountered

1594
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:02,490
someone malevolent they have to relearn

1595
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:04,199
the description of good and evil because

1596
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:07,019
if they don't they have no framework

1597
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:09,239
they're lost they think well there's a

1598
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:13,980
malevolence afoot in the world and I'm a

1599
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:15,899
naive I'm a naive I'm a prey animal a

1600
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,190
naive prey animal for the malevolence of

1601
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,539
the world it's like well good luck

1602
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,760
functioning under that set of

1603
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:22,800
assumptions man you just do not recover

1604
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,319
from that you stay at home in your

1605
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,180
burrow that's what you do well you have

1606
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:30,358
to you go down into that you think okay

1607
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:31,858
well malevolence is afoot I better be

1608
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:33,239
the sort of person that can understand

1609
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:35,608
it and deal with it and that's another

1610
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,229
reason why you have to transform

1611
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:40,348
yourself into a monster that's the

1612
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:43,980
Jungian incorporation of the shadow it's

1613
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:45,359
no bloody joke because the only thing

1614
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,858
that a monster won't mess with is

1615
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:48,328
another monster and you might say well I

1616
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:49,619
don't want to transform myself into a

1617
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:51,720
monster it's like you don't have a

1618
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:54,240
choice you can either be a pathetic

1619
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,039
monster or you can be a monster with

1620
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,709
some power those are your options

1621
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,259
there's no non monster alternative weak

1622
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:03,568
or strong and I don't mean strong like

1623
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:06,020
dominating tyrant strength that isn't

1624
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:08,429
what I mean at all I mean strength like

1625
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:10,798
functioning at a Funeral strength and

1626
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:12,179
that's a kind of monstrosity and when

1627
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,980
you're down in chaos that's what you

1628
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:18,808
have to rediscover well that's partly

1629
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,730
what that means you're lucky if you come

1630
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:22,380
back out remember I told you the story

1631
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,599
of Jonah at the beginning of the course

1632
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,480
it's like he had something to do and was

1633
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:29,068
refusing to do it and so God pulled him

1634
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,170
down to the depths of being and

1635
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:35,009
threatened him with death but worse not

1636
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:36,869
just death he'll really well he decided

1637
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,190
it was better to come popping up back

1638
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:44,640
into the light and go do what he was

1639
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:46,470
supposed to do well there's a reason

1640
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,960
that like that's the oldest story of

1641
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:51,209
mankind as far back as you go into the

1642
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:57,599
archives of history you find this story

1643
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:59,639
right and it's because well it's because

1644
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,380
not only is it because it's true it's

1645
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:02,879
because it's true and everyone knows

1646
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:05,280
it's true even though they don't know

1647
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,869
that they know that this is the story -

1648
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,120
it's the same thing there

1649
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:13,500
always a city it's always enclosed right

1650
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,119
there's always people who inhabit it

1651
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,190
there's always someone who's willing to

1652
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,589
notice that the dragon hasn't gone away

1653
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:21,030
the skulls are still around there's

1654
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:24,750
someone who's willing to come out of the

1655
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:27,120
fortress and and take that on right and

1656
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,960
to prefer perform the job of rescuing

1657
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,279
that's an eternal story are you the city

1658
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:36,300
are you the dragon are you the thing

1659
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,300
that engages voluntarily in combat with

1660
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,350
what lies outside your range of safety

1661
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,039
because that's what that image

1662
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:45,779
represents it's that is the monster

1663
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,210
amalgam symbolic amalgam of all that

1664
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,510
which lies outside your realm of safety

1665
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:53,610
you want to be safe forget that right

1666
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:56,430
that is that's not that's not in the

1667
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:58,710
cards you're not gonna be safe well then

1668
00:58:56,429 --> 00:59:01,529
you have to be meta safe and that's way

1669
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:03,179
better because then you're not safe but

1670
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:06,000
you know how to cope with danger well

1671
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:07,199
find that that solves the problem and

1672
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,900
maybe it's even a better solution

1673
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,849
because if you're safe then you just

1674
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,039
have to stay in your burrow but if you

1675
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:15,329
can confront danger then you can go

1676
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:17,460
wherever you want and you can have an

1677
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:18,809
adventure and maybe that's what you need

1678
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,179
to do is to go out and have an adventure

1679
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:24,329
so you don't even want safety because of

1680
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:26,339
how exciting is that not Dostoyevsky

1681
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:28,650
said very clearly let's say we made you

1682
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,570
perfectly safe all that you had to do is

1683
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,090
eat cakes and worry yourself with the

1684
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,600
continuation of the species what would

1685
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,300
you do

1686
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,069
you'd smash it all down as soon as you

1687
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,920
possibly could just so you had something

1688
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:42,480
interesting and challenging to do so you

1689
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,190
don't want safety you want to be able to

1690
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,619
cope with danger that's a whole

1691
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,690
different thing and I'm like this isn't

1692
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,909
again metaphysical that did clinical

1693
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:52,710
data on this is clear when you treat

1694
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:55,409
someone for an anxiety disorder like

1695
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:56,159
Agra phobia you do not get rid of their

1696
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:58,679
anxiety

1697
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,480
you make them braver that's way better

1698
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:03,239
there's no going back like once your

1699
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,070
agoraphobic your heart's not doing them

1700
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:06,989
you know it's it's it's missing beats

1701
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,580
now on that it's like death like the

1702
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:09,750
crocodile that's got the clock and it's

1703
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:12,150
in his stomach

1704
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:14,789
death is after you there's no there's no

1705
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,309
going back to naivety you don't get to

1706
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:20,009
be safe ever again well so what happens

1707
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:20,889
you get to be stronger well hey it turns

1708
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:27,519
out that's a better bar

1709
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:29,768
anyways so Lin is Bell an evolutionary

1710
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:31,449
arms race between early snakes and

1711
01:00:29,768 --> 01:00:33,278
mammals triggered the development of

1712
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:35,798
improved vision and large brain in

1713
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:38,318
primates a radical new theory suggests

1714
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,699
the idea proposed by Lin is Bell and

1715
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:41,528
anthropologist at the University of

1716
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:43,028
California suggests that snakes and

1717
01:00:41,528 --> 01:00:45,460
primates share a long and intimate

1718
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:47,739
history one that forced both groups to

1719
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,929
evolve new strategies as each attempted

1720
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:52,420
to gain the upper hand that's Hercules

1721
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:53,768
right well that's infinity that symbol

1722
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,960
and this is the snake you cut off one

1723
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:57,459
head and seven more growth it's like the

1724
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,929
it's an infinite snake you're never

1725
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,088
gonna run out of snakes those are the

1726
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:02,980
things that object to your plans well

1727
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:04,449
you can't get rid of the snake so what

1728
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,519
do you do you learn how to handle them

1729
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:07,960
right that's it that's that's the

1730
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:10,629
answers you learn how to become a

1731
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:13,539
handler of snakes both physical and

1732
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,480
metaphysical see you see the little halo

1733
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:17,650
around it I think that's st. George

1734
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,269
might be st. Michael but I think it's

1735
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:21,249
st. George why is he go to halo well

1736
01:01:19,268 --> 01:01:23,979
that's the Sun well what does that mean

1737
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:25,659
it's gold - Gold is pure it's the pure

1738
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,940
gold Sun it's associated with

1739
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:29,858
consciousness it's the pure gold Sun of

1740
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:34,389
consciousness that can confront the

1741
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:36,308
terrible thing that paralyzes and that's

1742
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:37,778
the same thing that's death right the

1743
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:39,249
clock in the stomach of the crocodile

1744
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:41,139
it's already got a taste of Captain Hook

1745
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:43,358
Captain Hook's no st. George that's why

1746
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:44,858
Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up I'd

1747
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:45,880
always sees his Captain Hook I don't

1748
01:01:44,858 --> 01:01:49,150
want to be Captain Hook

1749
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,650
he doesn't see this so he stays at home

1750
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,910
and plays video games with the rest of

1751
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:57,970
the Lost Boys look I got nothing against

1752
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:59,618
video games by the way I mean everything

1753
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:02,919
in moderation right and I mean they

1754
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:04,358
demand skill well so what's this you

1755
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,920
know there you are you go down into

1756
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:07,719
chaos and then you come back up and so

1757
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,809
you might say well am i this or am i the

1758
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:13,659
chaos or am i the new new solution an

1759
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:14,950
answer is you're not this or you

1760
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:16,659
shouldn't be because that's your old

1761
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,248
dead self right that's the thing that

1762
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:21,399
needs to burn away you know what chaos

1763
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:23,889
itself but you're also not the new

1764
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,889
regenerated order you're the thing that

1765
01:02:23,889 --> 01:02:29,230
can make the journey and more than that

1766
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:31,328
you're the thing that decides to make

1767
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:33,278
the journey voluntarily and then more

1768
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:34,720
than that you're the thing that decides

1769
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:37,329
to make the journey voluntarily

1770
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,919
for as long as it takes and that's where

1771
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:41,108
you derive your strength it's like

1772
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,420
there's no getting rid of chaos it's

1773
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:46,809
eternal there's no getting rid of order

1774
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,730
it's eternal those are both traps you

1775
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:50,289
mediate between them and that's where

1776
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,940
your strength lies and that's not only

1777
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:53,349
strength for you it's strength for you

1778
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,539
it's strength for the people around you

1779
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:57,519
strength for the community and strength

1780
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:59,769
for everything it's the thing that makes

1781
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:00,550
everything order itself properly and

1782
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:02,170
thrive

1783
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,490
you have to ask yourself and this is the

1784
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:05,980
thing you ask yourself this is the

1785
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:08,739
existential question do you want things

1786
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:11,349
to be ordered properly and thrive

1787
01:03:08,739 --> 01:03:13,329
because if the answer to that is yes you

1788
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:14,859
have to give up your hatred of being you

1789
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:16,150
have to give up your resentment you have

1790
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:18,369
to give up your martyrdom and your

1791
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,750
victimization and all of that because to

1792
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:22,420
the degree that you carry that forward

1793
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:25,750
it will corrupt you and you will not

1794
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:27,159
want the best because to be if you

1795
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,170
aren't the best you have to be without

1796
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:31,750
Rachel hey treated rancor and and

1797
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:34,659
resentment because you know if I resent

1798
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:36,969
you for your inadequacies or even for

1799
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:39,098
your for your accomplishments I'm not

1800
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:41,289
going to have a conversation with you

1801
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:42,820
where I'm aiming for the best I'm gonna

1802
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:44,170
have all sorts of motivations I'm gonna

1803
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,088
take you down somehow you know

1804
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:48,220
especially if you're successful that's

1805
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:49,869
the Cain and Abel story it's like I bet

1806
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:51,519
I want to be who you are but I can't be

1807
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:54,640
so I'll just cut you off at the knees

1808
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,199
and that'll do just fine and then I can

1809
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,569
get my revenge on you and I can get my

1810
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:00,129
revenge on being and you know the fact

1811
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,720
that it helps turn everything into hell

1812
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:07,630
well maybe that's just an additional

1813
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:11,079
benefit that's represented all sorts of

1814
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:14,530
different ways the masculine Sun and the

1815
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:17,230
feminine moon and that's Horus in gold

1816
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:19,480
right Horus is all speech and eyes and

1817
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:22,000
that's Osiris the god of tradition and

1818
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,849
Isis the queen of the underworld you see

1819
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,710
the same thing here suffering individual

1820
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:29,230
that transcends it by accepting it

1821
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:31,150
nested inside of society and the

1822
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:34,588
patriarchal structure nested inside the

1823
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:34,588
natural world and the feminine

1824
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:46,779
that's the same idea there that's Buddha

1825
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:50,349
emerging from the lotus flower and the

1826
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:52,570
lotus flower if its roots go down into

1827
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:55,029
the murk at the at the bottom of the of

1828
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:57,010
the the pond

1829
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:59,590
so it emerges out of the darkness and

1830
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:01,030
manifests itself and then it climbs

1831
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,829
upwards towards the light and then the

1832
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:05,110
Lotus floats on the surface of the water

1833
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:07,929
and blooms open and inside that the

1834
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,349
Buddha sits golden buddha sits in the

1835
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:10,929
light

1836
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:12,460
it's the flowering of being and that's

1837
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:14,169
that's a Mandela from the Union

1838
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,360
perspective it's the Mandela opens up

1839
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,900
and it reveals this mode of perfect

1840
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,940
being

1841
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,789
that's what the Buddha means and he

1842
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,019
found enlightenment underneath the tree

1843
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:25,269
because that's the human environment

1844
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:27,369
there's to find enlightenment underneath

1845
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:30,639
the tree he's got the Sun on his head -

1846
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:33,179
and he's gold for the same reason gold

1847
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,179
is pure

1848
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:48,039
you see the same thing in Hinduism so

1849
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:51,219
that's the yoni feminine symbol case you

1850
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:53,139
were wondering masculine symbol that's

1851
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:54,189
the union of the two right that's the

1852
01:05:53,139 --> 01:05:56,819
union of chaos and order

1853
01:05:54,190 --> 01:06:00,280
with a snake lurking in the background

1854
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:02,350
and it's golden because it's the union

1855
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,060
of those two things that produces the

1856
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:05,319
power of the snake that's something that

1857
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:07,179
you might think about you could think

1858
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,730
about those as two halves of the DNA

1859
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:12,639
molecule that is what they are although

1860
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:16,090
I can't tell you how I know that but

1861
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:19,480
it's the same idea it's the same idea

1862
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:21,039
here so this what happens here is that

1863
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,679
you see this is a very remarkable

1864
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,960
picture so this is Eve Eve is handing

1865
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,429
out skulls to mankind right

1866
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,800
it's self-consciousness and the

1867
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:31,659
discovery of death this is Mary as the

1868
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,760
church on this side and she's handing

1869
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:35,829
out these things that are the hosts it's

1870
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,710
those are pieces of Christ's body and

1871
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:41,259
see so he's put up there on this tree

1872
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:42,760
the same as the skull as an antidote the

1873
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,170
antidote is something that you

1874
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,820
incorporate and the thing you

1875
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,619
incorporate is the voluntary acceptance

1876
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,200
of suffering as the cure for death

1877
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:51,880
that's what that picture means people

1878
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:57,429
worked on that bloody picture for a long

1879
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:58,570
long long long time and you know we see

1880
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:00,819
the picture but we don't know what it

1881
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:03,580
means but that's what it means means the

1882
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:06,039
same thing that this means it means the

1883
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:08,500
same thing that this means means the

1884
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:10,599
same thing that this means see there's

1885
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,820
there's pride rock this is the

1886
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:15,159
Scandinavian world tree there's pride

1887
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,260
rock right there there's the territory

1888
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:19,149
outside see it's a serpent it's a snake

1889
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,610
that's the territory outside that's

1890
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:24,460
outside of the light and that's all in a

1891
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:26,470
tree that's how can you not read that as

1892
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:28,449
a history of the evolution of mankind

1893
01:07:26,469 --> 01:07:31,259
that's exactly what it is that's our

1894
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:31,259
eternal home

1895
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:44,400
well we better stop before that girl

1896
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:47,139
comes in

1897
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,449
it was very nice having you all in the

1898
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:51,489
class and I appreciated the warm welcome

1899
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:53,889
I got especially in January because it

1900
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:55,509
was a rough time in January and so I'm

1901
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:57,639

1902
01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:58,688
was a pleasure teaching you so good luck

1903

to you all

1904

I mean it be what you can be God you let

1905
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:06,188
the world dissolve around you otherwise

1906
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:07,599
that's not a good thing you've got

1907
01:08:06,188 --> 01:08:09,998
something that everyone needs man

1908
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,890
including yourself it's like let it out

1909
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:14,259
that's where everything you want is and

1910
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:16,689

1911
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:18,250
one of you so you know hoist up your

1912
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:20,769

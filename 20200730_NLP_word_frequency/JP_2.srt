1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:12,480
[Music]

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:20,480
now you know I used this picture to

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:22,189
represent my class and you might not

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,089
know anything about this picture it's

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:29,629
it's a picture of Jonah being thrown up

7
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:31,579
out of whales belly after spending three

8
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,789
days inside it it's an old biblical

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,649
story it's a myth it's a fairy tale

10
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:39,289
that's that's one way of looking at it

11
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:42,859
and and I don't mean that derogative

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,570
manner we know for example that some of

13
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,969
the Grimm's brothers fairy tales are

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,950
perhaps fifteen thousand years old

15
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,710
they've been traced way back they're

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,410
really really old and old stories are

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,789
strange and they're strange because well

18
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:57,979
they've been told generation after

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:02,000
generation after generation and so you

20
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:04,308
could imagine that something retold over

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,310
such an expand of expansive time has

22
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:09,978
been reduced to its gist many many times

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,590
and nothing that's in the story anymore

24
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:16,009
is superfluous it's all meaningful in

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,618
some sense it's sort of like a meta

26
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,379
story that's one way of thinking about

27
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:22,728
imagine that you took a hundred books

28
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:25,849
hundred adventure books and you had to

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:28,579
extract out the central features of an

30
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:30,559
adventure book now it's hard to do that

31
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,399
it's like you're averaging across them

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,789
or something like that

33
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,189
distilling them in some manner then you

34
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:40,009
get a meta adventure and it would be

35
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:42,590
like a myth upon which all adventures

36
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,109
are based and this story is actually one

37
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,109
of those stories and I'm going to tell

38
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,640
you what I think the story means and I'm

39
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,909
not saying that this is all it means

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,299
because most stories of this sort are in

41
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,609
some sense inexhaustible just like great

42
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,649
works of art are inexhaustible there

43
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,750
there's more information in them than

44
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:06,560
you can possibly articulate that's what

45
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,209
makes them profound that's why you go

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,219
look at them otherwise someone could

47
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,539
just tell you about the painting and

48
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:16,639
that would be the end of that but that

49
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:19,280
doesn't work so so that Jonah is being

50
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,158
spit up by this whale and of course on

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,959
the face of it that's an impossibility

52
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:28,479
because well

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,729
you can't live inside a whale that's why

54
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,238
it's impossible now you may remember and

55
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:36,039
likely do that you all know a story

56
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,030
about someone who is inside a whale

57
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:42,519
that's Pinocchio right and you know you

58
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,039
go to that movie maybe even as an adult

59
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,989
you watch that movie and Geppetto is

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,358
down there in the whale in his little

61
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,099
boat you know it's big cavernous inside

62
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:52,840
you don't really care that that's

63
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:55,479
there's a bunch of things you don't care

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,579
about you don't care that those are

65
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,848
drawings and not real people you don't

66
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:03,419
care about that and you don't care that

67
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:05,438
the inside of a whale isn't a cavern and

68
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,000
you don't care that Pinocchio is a

69
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,530
puppet for that matter none of that

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,959
matters to you at all and that's because

71
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,430
you're really strange creatures and you

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,769
don't even notice when you're doing

73
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,900
something absolutely absurd and that's

74
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,129
one of those times when you are but if

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,010
someone taps you on the shoulder and

76
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:24,668
says you know you're just watching

77
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:27,280
drawings of a puppet puppets can't

78
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,049
really move autonomously and now he's at

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,799
the bottom of the ocean you have no idea

80
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,609
why he's going to rescue his father and

81
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,769
you're just sitting there annoyed and

82
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,810
you're okay with that and you'll say

83
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,629
shut up because I want to finish

84
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,239
watching a movie and so that's

85
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:44,948
interesting you see that tells you

86
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,158
something about your unconscious if

87
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:50,139
you're psychoanalytically minded because

88
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,628
you're doing something that you cannot

89
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,769
account for now you might say well it's

90
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:55,870
it it's enjoyable

91
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,419
well that's deep man you're really

92
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,889
really going a long ways with that the

93
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:06,939
question is a why is it comprehensible B

94
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:09,819
why is it enjoyable see just exactly

95
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,340
what are you doing there and you think

96
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:14,649
that whatever you are doing there is so

97
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,629
valuable that you'll actually pay to do

98
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,780
it weird very very weird and you know

99
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:27,009
when you read about let's say the

100
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:29,908
archaic rituals of tribal people and you

101
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:32,620
ask yourself just what are they up to

102
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:34,300
you might think well they're up to the

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,209
same thing that you're up to when you go

104
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,590
see a movie so and then you might also

105
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:41,079
notice that the

106
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:42,879
most expensive artifacts or among the

107
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,759
most expensive artifacts that human

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,939
beings create our movies they spend

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,569
hundreds of millions of dollars on them

110
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:54,639
and we consider that a good deal and you

111
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,069
know it drives our technology to because

112
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,839
the high-tech movies like the Marvel

113
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,209
movies that require so much computer

114
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,849
animation they actually drive the demand

115
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:06,699
for high-end graphics chips so our

116
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,180
technological advance forward is

117
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:13,000
actually motivated in part by our desire

118
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:19,360
to represent things fictional II in ever

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,319
more spectacular manner so Jonah well

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,610
let me tell you the story of Jonah and

121
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,490
I'll tell you why I'm gonna tell you it

122
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,470
this is from Camille Paglia who's a

123
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,930
critic of the modern University and a

124
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,260
very brilliant woman I would say very

125
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,480
controversial incredibly rapid speaker

126
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,219
and she can think so fast it's just

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,200
unbelievable she's really fun to watch

128
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,910
if you like that sort of thing

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,500
vicious adversary in an argument she

130
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,470
says the number one problem in academia

131
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,790
today is not ignorant students but

132
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:56,890
ignorant professors who have substituted

133
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,960
narrow expertise and theoretical

134
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,519
sophistication a preposterous term for

135
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,129
breadth and depth of learning in the

136
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:07,089
world history of art and thought art is

137
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:10,120
a vast interconnected web work a

138
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:12,819
fabricated tradition and over

139
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:23,980
concentration on any one point is a

140
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:25,480
distortion here's here's a problem I had

141
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,610
I wrestled with this when I was trying

142
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,350
to understand some of the things that

143
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm going to teach you about there's

144
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,680
some things that you kind of have to

145
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,269
grasp as a whole you know sometimes you

146
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,350
have a flash of insight and a bunch of

147
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:40,779
things that you didn't know we're

148
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,460
related fall together that that's

149
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,949
supposed to happen in psychotherapy when

150
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,599
you link different disparate patterns of

151
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,229
behavior together because you've linked

152
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,180
them say with a single cause and you get

153
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:59,970
this like excited feeling

154
00:06:52,180 --> 00:07:02,530
of illumination and possibility and

155
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,320
there are forms of communication that

156
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:07,689
require the simultaneously the

157
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:16,659
simultaneous realization of a multitude

158
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:17,288
of disparate phenomena like a movie can

159
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,419
be like that

160
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:20,860
you know you you listen to a movie you

161
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:22,750
watch movie and then you don't know what

162
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,660
the hell is going on and then something

163
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,329
happens near the end and bed everything

164
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,490
clicks together and it's cuz you've sort

165
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:33,038
of seen the thing as a whole and a lot

166
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,800
of the things that we a lot of the ways

167
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:40,449
that we interact with the world that are

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,668
mysterious are like that there and this

169
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,490
is what peg lay is referring to is that

170
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:48,990
and this is a psychoanalytic proposition

171
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,990
I would say or a romantic proposition

172
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:57,009
now the idea roughly is that way out in

173
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:59,198
the periphery of reality are all those

174
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,209
things that not only do you not know but

175
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,430
you don't even know you don't know right

176
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:05,620
there you're completely blind to their

177
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,538
existence and then there's unknown

178
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,430
things that you have some suspicions

179
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:12,639
about and then there's unknown things

180
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:17,228
that you can start to imagine and and

181
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,199
act out and dramatize and so all of that

182
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:22,449
is on the periphery of our knowledge

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,330
that's a psychoanalytic dictum where the

184
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,550
thoughts come from well partly they're

185
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,829
nested in dreams dreams are the

186
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,080
birthplace of thoughts fantasy it's not

187
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,968
that surprising fantasy is the

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,589
birthplace of ideas you know if you're

189
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,219
thinking about what you're gonna do in

190
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,159
the future

191
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,829
you enter into a reverie a dream state

192
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,899
and you contemplate multiple

193
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,799
possibilities and then you start

194
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,220
thinking them through

195
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:52,509
use your imagination to search beyond

196
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:57,570
where you are and the collective human

197
00:08:52,509 --> 00:09:00,879
attempt to do that is our mysterious

198
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,570
humanistic artistic tradition which is

199
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,019
very difficult to justify from a formal

200
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,339
articulate point of view

201
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:11,709
what good is dance like what is it that

202
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,910
you're doing when you're dancing

203
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:17,628
well you don't care because you like to

204
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:21,860
dance why well you don't know what you

205
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:24,709
do it's built into you music musics a

206
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,509
human universal cultures use music to

207
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,849
organize themselves right they use music

208
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,579
to catalyze their identities they use

209
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,379
music to unite around you know in in

210
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:37,428
more archaic societies less

211
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:41,028
differentiated societies let's say no a

212
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:43,129
mask that represents part of the family

213
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:45,438
tradition will have a particular design

214
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,548
and there'll be a particular song

215
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,669
written for it and there'll be a

216
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:52,458
particular dance about it and the song

217
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:54,438
and the dance or something like the

218
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,688
symbolic representation of a mode of

219
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:58,578
being in the world like maybe the mask

220
00:09:56,688 --> 00:10:00,169
is a wolf mask and so you act out the

221
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,878
wolf and there's music that goes along

222
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,229
with that and you think well what are

223
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,850
you doing when you're acting out the

224
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,110
wolf and part of that is what you're

225
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,769
trying you're trying to understand

226
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,199
wolves

227
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,698
you know it's an image it's imitation in

228
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:12,798
part and you know if you live in the

229
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:15,289
natural world and if you hunt and if

230
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:16,669
you're preyed upon then understanding

231
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,490
the things that you're hunting and

232
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:21,708
preying upon is useful and there's also

233
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,698
pull out perhaps useful things to learn

234
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:27,979
from them and so we play this strange

235
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:30,048
symbolic game with the world like

236
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,119
children pretending that's another way

237
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:35,269
of thinking about it and we do that to

238
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:37,939
act out and to begin to understand

239
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:43,039
things we don't understand like how to

240
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:48,409
act that's now for me the most important

241
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:54,289
question in life is not what the world

242
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:57,068
is made of and in fact I would say

243
00:10:54,289 --> 00:11:00,349
that's a relatively new preoccupation of

244
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:03,168
humankind you know we didn't really

245
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:08,360
formalize you could say that the ancient

246
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:09,828
Greeks originated laid the groundwork

247
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,778
for the emergence of an empirical

248
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:16,938
science and then it emerged more

249
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:22,730
formally with bacon and Descartes and

250
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:24,740
Newton five six hundred years ago not

251
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,470
very long like a blink blink to the eye

252
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,389
in human terms before that people were

253
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,798
engineers they could build things and so

254
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,259
forth but they didn't know how to

255
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:38,240
they weren't scientists they didn't

256
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,178
really conceptualize the world as an

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,369
objective place we do that automatically

258
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:48,409
because science has seeped so far into

259
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:50,538
our set of presuppositions that doesn't

260
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:53,600
make us good scientists by the way but

261
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:55,249
it does make us believe that the

262
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,769
fundamental reality of the world is an

263
00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:02,928
objective reality and I'm not going to

264
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,918
dispute that particularly but leaves one

265
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,918
set of questions unanswered

266
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:10,609
probably by its nature because it wasn't

267
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,308
designed to answer the question then

268
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:18,230
that question is how should one conduct

269
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:20,318
oneself in the world and that's an

270
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,699
important thing since you're alive and

271
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:25,009
hypothetically you'd rather stay alive

272
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:26,899
and well you're alive you probably don't

273
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,480
want to suffer any more than you have to

274
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,999
and no more stupidly than you have to

275
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,139
and it might also be good if some of the

276
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,209
things that you want it actually

277
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:38,899
happened and so you know you're

278
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:40,969
motivated to know how to act and and

279
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,499
people are always telling each other how

280
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,089
to act we're sending each other

281
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,100
information all the time about how to

282
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,199
act we do that with our the expressions

283
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,850
on our face and of course when we talk

284
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,128
to people we always look at their face

285
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,240
and that's because their face tells you

286
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,668
what they're up to

287
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,899
you know if they're smiling and paying

288
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:59,720
attention to you well then you can

289
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:02,778
assume that you're doing something right

290
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,668
and if they're looking annoyed or

291
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:07,159
disgusted that's a particularly bad one

292
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:07,429
then you might think you might take a

293
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,588
hint

294
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,209
from that especially if you know three

295
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,120
or four people are doing it at the same

296
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:17,240
time and so we're reflecting we're

297
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,240
reflecting some ideal to one another

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,889
constantly and the more attentive you

299
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,379
are the more likely you are to act in

300
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,179
accordance with that ideal and the more

301
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,278
like you likely you are to move towards

302
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:34,009
it you may not even know what the ideal

303
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,240
is in an articulated sense in fact you

304
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,330
probably don't you know you could come

305
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,009
up with a well you know a good person is

306
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,020
nice and friendly and you know

307
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,649
cooperative and yeah yeah you know

308
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:47,419
that's all just cliche but you don't you

309
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,980
know your conception might be very

310
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,449
Hollow it's very likely that it's very

311
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,240
Hollow even though you may be able to

312
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,580
act in a very sophisticated manner

313
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,269
alright so anyways this is a story I'd

314
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,649
say oh it's a meta story it's it's what

315
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,329
would happen if you collected a bunch of

316
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,610
stories and then you extract it out a

317
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,649
story from them and it's sort of a story

318
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,919
about destiny and it's couched in a

319
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:13,360
religious language but that's okay

320
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:18,019
because most of these distilled stories

321
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,930
are form the foundation of religious

322
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,329
texts and religious texts and myth and

323
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:27,259
myths and stories are as I said part of

324
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,839
the outer perimeter of our society they

325
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:33,049
have a they have a coherent nature and

326
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,360
it's all and they form a foundation and

327
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:39,169
it's on that foundation that everything

328
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,509
that you take for granted rests even if

329
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,909
you don't understand the foundation so I

330
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:46,189
can give you an example there's a

331
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:48,949
metaphysical idea that underlies Western

332
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,820
civilization and that metaphysical idea

333
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,430
is that the individual has transcendent

334
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,680
worth that's that's the idea from which

335
00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:00,409
the notion of natural rights is derived

336
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,000
and of course our legal system is

337
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:04,759
predicated on the idea that you have

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,409
certain natural rights they're enshrined

339
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,269
in the Bill of Rights for example and in

340
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:15,230
the in the states when the bills Bill of

341
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:17,028
Rights was being formulated when the

342
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,959
legislation Ridge the legislation that

343
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:20,720
found that the state was being

344
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,259
formulated the formulators said we hold

345
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,259
these

346
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,299
truths to be self-evident what does that

347
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,580
mean

348
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:32,029
they're axioms of faith right there

349
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,759
they're propositions and there's no

350
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,069
proof for them there they're a mode of

351
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,639
operation in the world and so the

352
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,110
hypothesis is something like well if I

353
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,620
treat you like there's something about

354
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,060
you that has transcendent value implicit

355
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,310
intrinsic value whatever that might be

356
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,019
and there are stories about that and

357
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:53,959
we'll talk about that and you do the

358
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,840
same to me and then we set up a body of

359
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,240
laws that recognizes the sovereignty of

360
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,410
the individual so that the law itself

361
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,090
has to act with respect towards every

362
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,980
individual even if that individual has

363
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,160
done something reprehensible which is

364
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,570
very weird if you think about it

365
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:19,159
then our society will work better and

366
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:22,760
well perhaps that's true but for better

367
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,740
or worse that is what this society is

368
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,659
predicated on and that's a very very

369
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,639
very very very very old idea and it's an

370
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:34,759
idea that people came to with great

371
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,100
difficulty because it was over thousands

372
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,319
of years that people learned how to take

373
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,029
their little tribal groups which are

374
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,440
always squabbling with one another right

375
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,110
because there's human beings they're

376
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,320
very violent and tribal groups are by no

377
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,899
means civilized it's there's no noble

378
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,730
savage like the Europeans thought if you

379
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,750
study tribal groups in the world today

380
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,220
the murder

381
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:00,710
the death rate by violence is

382
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:03,019
unbelievably high so something unites a

383
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,730
tribe within a tribe it's often kinship

384
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,379
but then tribes come together to form

385
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,529
larger civilizations and they have to

386
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,880
determine some sort of meta principle

387
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,709
that guides them so that they can

388
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,449
cooperate and come together without

389
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,730
destroying one another and they have to

390
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,519
extract out a principle by which the

391
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,680
society might function and that has to

392
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,759
work and then as societies get bigger

393
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,170
and bigger and bigger and bigger and

394
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,019
bigger they have to bring more and more

395
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,269
of these diverse traditions together and

396
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:32,839
extract out something from them that has

397
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:34,879
power and functional utility and that

398
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,439
allows people to unite

399
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,460
and so this is one of the stories that

400
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,100
talks about that it's a story about

401
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,140
individual responsibility and what

402
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:53,719
happens when it's not heated so you know

403
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:58,070
because we could say you are a social

404
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,690
creature right to the core and most of

405
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:01,849
your environment is other people and

406
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,610
those other people want something from

407
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:06,740
you and you want something from them so

408
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,819
you're gonna play games with them you're

409
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,740
either gonna be good at it you're gonna

410
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:13,700
be bad at it but you're gonna play games

411
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,640
with them and so the game might have

412
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,370
rules really sophisticated rules in fact

413
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,530
and you'd expect that because as your

414
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:25,359
behavior more and more approximates an

415
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,710
ideal assuming such a thing exists then

416
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,329
you're more and more sophisticated and

417
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,329
the nature of the ideal is perhaps more

418
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:35,049
and more complex and and difficult to

419
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:37,970
understand you get a hint of this though

420
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,460
you can get a hint of this because you

421
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:45,259
will see if you pay attention to your

422
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,850
own soul your psyche your unconscious

423
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:49,579
you'll see that there are people that

424
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:51,769
you admire and that there are people

425
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:53,960
that you have contempt for and that's

426
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:55,250
and it isn't necessarily that you're a

427
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,579
hundred percent accurate in your

428
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:02,720
judgment you know it's not such a bad

429
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:08,000
idea to criticize your first impressions

430
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,490
but those states exist and so there's a

431
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,900
reason you admire someone and there's a

432
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,789
reason you have contempt for someone

433
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,009
there may be multiple reasons and that's

434
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:17,869
a hint to your intrinsic value structure

435
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:19,369
it's a hint about your intrinsic value

436
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,979
structure right you wouldn't admire

437
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:24,169
someone unless there was something about

438
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,940
them that you valued and perhaps that

439
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,490
you would also like to be able to do and

440
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,830
he wouldn't despise someone or have

441
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,450
contempt for them if you didn't feel

442
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,759
that something they were doing was wrong

443
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,220
and that it would be wrong if you did it

444
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:40,069
too and so you're bringing to bear on

445
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,079
the situation an implicit morality and

446
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:44,079
you have to do that because as I said

447
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,230
you can't act without a morality because

448
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:54,400
if you're gonna act you're gonna try to

449
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,829
make things better that otherwise why

450
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,269
bother and if you're acting to make

451
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,500
things better than some things have to

452
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,930
be better and some things have to be

453
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,259
worse and that's a value structure so

454
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:11,200
you have one

455
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:14,019
all right so Jonah he gets a call from

456
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,620
God and God tells them that there's a

457
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:22,289
city Nineveh that's falling into moral

458
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:26,109
disarray now what does that mean well

459
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,509
it's a universal story it's like all

460
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:32,079
cultures are always falling into

461
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:35,289
disarray it's their nature just entropy

462
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,179
does that right things change the world

463
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,859
changes the environment changes and the

464
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,390
culture doesn't keep up very well and

465
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:43,599
then of course it has corrupt elements

466
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:46,930
and so it's an interior eternal story

467
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,759
the individual is always placed in

468
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,519
relationship to a culture that's

469
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,789
somewhat corrupt and then the question

470
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:57,069
is well what do you do about it and if

471
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,139
the answer is nothing well then it'll

472
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:01,720
just get more corrupt and if the answer

473
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,700
is be corrupt - then it will just get

474
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,329
more corrupt so the answer has to be to

475
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:13,509
oppose the corruption because that's the

476
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:16,480
only way it's going to stop now god

477
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:20,379
threatens to destroy this city because

478
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,529
of its corruption and I don't think you

479
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,920
need to presume anything particularly

480
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:29,589
metaphysical about that to understand it

481
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,060
it's very straight forward that the more

482
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,339
corrupt the culture is and the less

483
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,379
Trust is possible between individuals

484
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:37,809
the less productive of the culture is

485
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,430
going to be because why do anything if

486
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,769
some corrupt person is just gonna come

487
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,360
and take it you know it might even be

488
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:46,109
that the culture is so corrupt that if

489
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,549
you are good for something and you

490
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:50,379
produce resources you're actually more

491
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,779
likely to get killed because you have

492
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,310
something of value so like this just

493
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,349
you're just not going anywhere with that

494
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:59,019
and why would you work if you didn't

495
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:01,209
have any sense that you know you

496
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:04,089
store up the value of your work for some

497
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,799
reasonable time in the future so if the

498
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,079
society is corrupt and there's no trust

499
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,539
its degenerating and you know it might

500
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,220
live for a while but isn't it last very

501
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:18,159
long and so that's the idea corrupt

502
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:20,890
societies collapse that leaves open what

503
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,430
corruption means anyways Jonah

504
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,620
thanks no no bloody way I'm not going to

505
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,880
that City they can go to hell as far as

506
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,309
I'm concerned and that's really what he

507
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,650
thinks and why in the world should I do

508
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:35,169
anything about it anyways and these are

509
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,810
good objections it's like why would you

510
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,380
do that and you'll face this believe me

511
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:43,529
in your life you will face this in fact

512
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,990
you already do always constantly

513
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,490
continually in small ways perhaps when

514
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,710
you're interacting with people who

515
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,180
aren't treating you properly and when

516
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,529
you're acting and those might be your

517
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,390
parents they might be your friends they

518
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:59,379
might be people at your workplace they

519
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:02,130
might be professors they're playing a

520
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,880
crooked game and you don't like it and

521
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,670
you know it's crooked

522
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,620
and so then the question is well what

523
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,690
should you do about it well if you know

524
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,489
you're correct know it's crooked it's

525
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,049
not so good to play along with it I mean

526
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,880
we'll say that you know it's crooked by

527
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,980
your own standard of values it D

528
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,960
degrades you to play along with it

529
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,880
you're gonna stand up and oppose it well

530
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,490
no probably not

531
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,380
you're probably gonna do what Jonah did

532
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,470
jump on a ship and get the hell out of

533
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,210
there and you know that's a logical

534
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,700
thing to do but it doesn't solve the

535
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,400
problem and I think this has something

536
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,090
to do with human ethical responsibility

537
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,940
because there are other old stories and

538
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:51,609
I'll tell you one likely where the son

539
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:54,759
of the king the Lion King the son of the

540
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:57,429
king he goes off and he's some pathetic

541
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,379
adolescent and then he's shamed by the

542
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,720
reappearance of his old girlfriend into

543
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,030
turning into something vaguely useful

544
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,049
and he opens his eyes and he goes back

545
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:09,759
and he fights scar and you know it's a

546
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:12,759
scene of hell right because there's fire

547
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,519
everywhere and he fights scar finds

548
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,289
skaar killed his father he casts him

549
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,519
into the pit roughly speaking and then

550
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,220
the rain comes and then you know the

551
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,950
movie returns to its beginning

552
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,589
fundamentally it's a paradise paradise

553
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:33,819
lost' Paradise Regained that's the movie

554
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:35,470
and and I mean that's the story of human

555
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,899
beings you know you're in a place that's

556
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,490
working out pretty well something

557
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,740
happens to knock you off your perch

558
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,509
you're down in the chaos for a good

559
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,609
amount of time and maybe you never get

560
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,400
out but maybe you learn something down

561
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:51,548
there maybe a strength in your character

562
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,090
then you pop up to a new place and maybe

563
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:57,279
it's better better aim better you now

564
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:59,039
I'm not being overly optimistic about

565
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:04,359
this I know perfectly well that people

566
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,789
encounter impediments during their life

567
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:10,119
that they find almost impossible to

568
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:15,879
recover from but it's the best shot you

569
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:17,500
have so anyways Jonah runs away but God

570
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,080
isn't very happy about that because it's

571
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,769
actually Jonah's destiny it's necessary

572
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:27,189
for Jonah to repair the city so God

573
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:29,769
sends a storm and you know the waves are

574
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,840
high and and and I think what that means

575
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,700
is because the water is often a symbol

576
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,409
for the unconscious and that's because

577
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,090
things lurk down there in the water and

578
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,070
that you could pull up that that are

579
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:40,750
useful monstrous things that you can

580
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:42,609
pull up they're useful you can fish for

581
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,710
them you can go fishing in your own

582
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:46,629
being for answers which is what you do

583
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,539
when you try to think right you ask

584
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,610
yourself a question and you wait maybe

585
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:53,589
an answer appears it's like where did

586
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:55,808
that come from you didn't know what the

587
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:58,829
answer was before it appeared but it

588
00:25:55,808 --> 00:26:05,200
just popped into being out of nowhere

589
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:07,298
who knows so you fish so anyways the

590
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,100
waves come and the boats gonna be

591
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:10,509
knocked over it and that's what happens

592
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:13,569
I think when you know when you know you

593
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:16,029
should do something I mean everyone has

594
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:17,319
the this experience I believe perhaps

595
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:19,359
you would be willing to put up your

596
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,629
hands if this experience is foreign to

597
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,250
you okay

598
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,540
just part of your telling you you should

599
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,670
do something and it's hard

600
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,379
to do it effortful and maybe you're

601
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,900
afraid of it and so you don't do it you

602
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,790
just procrastinate right and so how do

603
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,440
you feel about that good I mean so what

604
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,109
do you feel that you're betraying

605
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,910
yourself your anxiety actually gets

606
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:45,469
worse not better even though you know

607
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,180
you can put it off moment to moment but

608
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,620
that doesn't help because every time you

609
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,509
put it off the anxiety just grows a

610
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:54,109
little bit you're not proud of yourself

611
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:56,349
you have a sense that you're making

612
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:58,250
things more chaotic than they should be

613
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,439
you know and if you do that long enough

614
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,940
and I'm sure many of you have had that

615
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,160
experience if you do that long enough if

616
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,049
that becomes habitual things will get so

617
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,070
stormy around you that you'll fall right

618
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:14,839
into the into the chaos into the watery

619
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:16,490
chaos and maybe you'll drown so it's not

620
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:21,379
a very good idea to run from your

621
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:24,200
destiny let's say whatever that might be

622
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,640
and you need a destiny you need a place

623
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,130
to aim at because that's what gives your

624
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,830
life meaning and you need meaning in

625
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,690
your life because life is hard so you

626
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:36,799
know you need something to buttress

627
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,480
yourself against that so anyways they

628
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,919
wake joan up and jonah says that's

629
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,299
probably my fault because like i'm

630
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,100
running away from something i'm supposed

631
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,240
to do and you know god isn't very happy

632
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,819
about that so why don't you just throw

633
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,740
me over to overboard and the crew isn't

634
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:50,210
very happy about that but the waves are

635
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,769
really starting to come up and joan is

636
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:57,259
pretty insistent that he's the cause of

637
00:27:51,769 --> 00:28:00,740
the problem and so they draw they draw a

638
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:04,519
lot and and jonah is chosen and so they

639
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,519
decided to toss him into the ocean and

640
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,009
immediately everything's calm so he's a

641
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,680
center of chaos because he's not doing

642
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:16,519
what he's supposed to do fine well then

643
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,150
that whale comes up and swallows him and

644
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:24,339
then he's in the whale for three days

645
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,620
now that's a weird thing the whale

646
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:30,709
that's the way all that

647
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:32,000
Gepetto's ian that's a dragon it's the

648
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,519
thing that you have to go out there and

649
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,519
conquer to get something of value now

650
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:46,200
when you've made an error when you've

651
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:48,810
fallen off the pathway when you deviated

652
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,730
from what you know you should do it

653
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,970
produces a state of internal chaos and

654
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,769
worry and concern you're you're thrust

655
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,990
into the unknown you're thrust into

656
00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:00,269
unknown territory and chaos you don't

657
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,430
know what to do and that's often

658
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,089
symbolized by the encounter with a with

659
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,000
a monster

660
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:07,799
like a dragon something that lives under

661
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,329
the water that's and I think the reason

662
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,329
for that is as far as I've been able to

663
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:15,299
tell is that human beings because we've

664
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:16,980
been prey animals for forever in our

665
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,839
battle with carnivorous lizards for

666
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,339
example and alligators and even

667
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,439
dinosaurs because there were dinosaurs

668
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,049
around at the time of our most distant

669
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,080
ancestors there was even a cat at one

670
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:31,680
point that was that was adapted with

671
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:34,829
teeth to pierce human skulls so it had a

672
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,500
head that was exactly shaped to grab you

673
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:39,299
here and put a tooth through the back of

674
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,859
your skull so like we've come through

675
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:45,750
some rough times man and we have a

676
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:48,149
system in our mind that's a threat

677
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,099
predator detection system that's the

678
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,190
thing that makes little kids think about

679
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:55,439
monsters in the dark right because well

680
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,759
there is monsters in the dark parents

681
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,460
always say well there's no monsters in

682
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,259
the dark it's like that's not true the

683
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,360
dark is full of monsters there might not

684
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,009
be any in your room right at that moment

685
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,339
but that doesn't mean there aren't

686
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:10,289
monsters in the dark and crimes take

687
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,119
place like criminals don't get up at

688
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:14,849
6:00 in the morning and like you know

689
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,469
have breakfast and go rob a bank they do

690
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:20,189
it they do that sort of thing at night

691
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:23,160
people do the things that are fit for

692
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,710
the night in the night and lots of

693
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,080
predators are nocturnal and you can't

694
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,920
see very well in the dark and kids

695
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,500
aren't stupid

696
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:35,220
you know they've evolved to stay pretty

697
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,230
damn close to the fire because the kids

698
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,589
that wandered away from the fire got

699
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:44,190
picked off by hyenas and lions and you

700
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:50,329
know crocodiles and whatever else the

701
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:50,330
hell was out there to eat the unwary so

702
00:30:52,470 --> 00:31:00,100
the circuit that we use to to defend

703
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:03,220
ourselves against predators as we've

704
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:05,259
evolved cortically that circuit has has

705
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,420
come to represent what we don't know in

706
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:10,740
general because the Predators of course

707
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:13,630
inhabit where we don't know and so

708
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,490
evolution is a conservative force and we

709
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,880
use the circuits that we've evolved to

710
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:21,970
represent new things and so the unknown

711
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,680
the chaos is often represented by a

712
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,410
monster that swallows you up and pulls

713
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,720
you down and you know when you're

714
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:31,870
feeling terrible you don't say well I'm

715
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,519
feeling up you say I'm feeling down well

716
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:38,139
why is that well down is worse I guess

717
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,759
you're flat on the ground when you're

718
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,350
down or you're in a hole or something

719
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,079
like that you're hiding in a hole

720
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:45,849
you know it's down and you're threatened

721
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,369
by something you know maybe you're

722
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:50,319
threatened by your own inadequacy that

723
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:52,239
might be part of it maybe that's partly

724
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,929
what you imagine as a monstrous force

725
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,309
because you know your proclivity towards

726
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,410
procrastination and your weakness of

727
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,399
character is part and parcel of why you

728
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,720
happen to be in the underworld and

729
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,380
that's the underworld the mythological

730
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,200
underworld that's where you go when

731
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,240
things fall apart and if you understand

732
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,549
that if you know that that's what that

733
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,700
means then you have one of the keys that

734
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:21,369
opens up ancient stories to you and you

735
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,069
understand things you could live can be

736
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:28,179
an organized going very well and then

737
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:30,879
something comes up and poof everything

738
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,620
changes some axiom that you were living

739
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,080
by and it might be the existence of a

740
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:40,209
partner might be a job it might be your

741
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:43,119
health any of those things go on and you

742
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,190
go somewhere when that happens you go

743
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,379
somewhere it's a state of being you're

744
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,490
still in the same world but it's not the

745
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,350
same at all anymore

746
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,420
everything about it is different it's

747
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:55,779
all negative and dark and you don't know

748
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,060
what to do you're confused and so what

749
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,829
do you do down there in the underworld

750
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:03,220
when things have fallen apart especially

751
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:04,000
if oh if it's the worst possible case

752
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,100
scenario and you

753
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,319
realize that you actually had something

754
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:10,149
to do with your demise that's really

755
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,159
annoying you know when something bad

756
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,050
happens to you and then you know you

757
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,759
grind yourself into bits trying to

758
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:19,899
figure out what the hell happened and

759
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,940
then you realize that well you were

760
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,350
playing a causal role now sometimes

761
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,330
you're so depressed you assume you're

762
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,980
playing a causal role and you work it's

763
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:29,079
not easy to figure out by any stretch of

764
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,849
the imagination and it isn't that

765
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:35,019
everyone who does something terrible is

766
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:37,029
at fault for it but sometimes you find

767
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:38,529
that you are off the path somehow and

768
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:40,629
maybe even that you knew it and they

769
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:44,230
didn't attend to it and that's why all

770
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,420
of this hit the fan and so then down

771
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,009
there in that chaos you decide that

772
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,850
you're going to do what you're supposed

773
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:55,029
to do instead and then maybe you get to

774
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:58,769
rise up again renewed if you're lucky

775
00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:02,289
and then you can go fix the city and

776
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:05,349
that's what this story's about and

777
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,849
that's why I picked the image to

778
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:10,289
represent the course because really what

779
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:13,539
happens you see with the psychoanalysts

780
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:16,179
the road due to health if you're not

781
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:17,409
doing well which means that as you act

782
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,019
in the world you're not getting what you

783
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,690
want there's something wrong with your

784
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:25,449
the match between your presuppositions

785
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,030
and your actions habitual and the way

786
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:30,579
the world is responding to you and so

787
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,050
it's not turning out for you and the

788
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,469
question is well what can you do about

789
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,649
that

790
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:38,168
and one answer might be to examine

791
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,148
yourself for presuppositions and action

792
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:42,638
patterns that are not serving you well

793
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:44,079
and to find out what they are and what

794
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,269
to do about them and maybe some of that

795
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,099
is maybe you're not moving forward

796
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:49,840
because of fear and maybe that fear is

797
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,190
grounded in terrible experiences that

798
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,769
you had in the past that you've never

799
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,450
been able to understand and maybe one of

800
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:57,519
the ways of gluing yourself back

801
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,460
together and expanding your personality

802
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,440
so that you could in fact live properly

803
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,880
in the world is to go back to those

804
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,130
terrible events and untie them and

805
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,280
straighten them out and understand them

806
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:14,730
and drop them and that's what

807
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,920
psychotherapy is about in large part

808
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,150
psychoanalytic behavioral doesn't matter

809
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,010
what are you afraid of what are you

810
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,099
avoiding what are you failing to develop

811
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:30,170
maybe from fear maybe from avoidance god

812
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,920
only knows maybe from disgust how can

813
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,570
you get over it

814
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,170
how can you reclaim those parts of your

815
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,170
self

816
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,260
now I said in the first lecture that I

817
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:56,090
was going to try to provide you with a

818
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:57,800
schema into which you could place the

819
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,370
theorists that we're going to discuss

820
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,100
and it requires going down deep to do

821
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,359
that and there are presuppositions in my

822
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,980
presupposition and this is a

823
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,450
psychoanalytic presupposition it's

824
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:14,630
predicated on a poetic tradition I would

825
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:17,389
say don't an ancient tradition I learned

826
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,960
most of it from reading Jung it was Carl

827
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:24,500
Jung that helped me understand that

828
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,740
we're nested inside a dream that we have

829
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:32,389
to be because we don't know everything

830
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:33,979
we have to take things as Givens and the

831
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:37,429
things that we take it as Givens are

832
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,769
nested inside stories and we accept the

833
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:43,819
stories as valid and then outside the

834
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:46,009
stories is the absolute unknown you know

835
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,970
and that's partly the stories are tricky

836
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:52,550
you know that one of the classic stories

837
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:58,009
it's a variant of the the Jonas story I

838
00:36:52,550 --> 00:37:02,650
would say is st. George and the dragon

839
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:05,270
and that that story was represented in

840
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,539
during the Renaissance and during

841
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:11,269
medieval times thousands and thousands

842
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:13,070
of ways it's like the story of st.

843
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:17,259
Patrick who chased the snakes out of

844
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:22,670
Ireland same idea and that the typical

845
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:25,790
st. George story is the Hobbit or Harry

846
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:27,380
Potter so in the second volume of Harry

847
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:28,820
Potter correct me if I have any of these

848
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,269
details wrong you remember there's that

849
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,220
snake the basilisk so this is Magic

850
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:37,039
Castle right you guys have no problem

851
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,480
without Magic Castle no problem there's

852
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,909
an or if he's an orphan he goes to the

853
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,250
Magic Castle to learn how to be more

854
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:45,289
than normal right the muggles he has a

855
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,789
muggle family we're not too happy with

856
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:50,090
the muggle family like as

857
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:52,340
representatives of normal people they

858
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,960
they have some blacks now of course the

859
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,820
reason for that is that well that's what

860
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,800
teenagers often feel about their parents

861
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,050
right they fail Jesus these couldn't

862
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,600
really be my parents I must have some

863
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:04,730
other parents who are like

864
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,009
together those are like magical parents

865
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,990
right parents that live in the sky and

866
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,020
of course Harry Potter has earthly

867
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:14,209
parents that's the muggles and Dursley I

868
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:17,860
think is the kid he's at one he's a

869
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:21,349
wonderful piece of work and you know

870
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:24,050
ill-formed a spoiled ill-formed

871
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:26,509
selfish very far from the ideal he's a

872
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,850
foil for Harry and of course he's

873
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,340
appreciated and doted on and Harry is

874
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,559
actually punished for his virtues that's

875
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,570
a classic story right to to be punished

876
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,340
for your virtues I mean if you look at

877
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,620
the story the central story in

878
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,210
Christianity the central story and

879
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,099
Christianity is about someone who is

880
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,019
precisely punished in the worst possible

881
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,759
way for the highest possible virtues

882
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,650
that's what it makes it an archetypal

883
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,410
story because there isn't anything more

884
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,450
unfair than that and so it's a limit in

885
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,609
a sense you it can't be worse than that

886
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:58,369
being punished for being you know

887
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,200
unworthy it's like yeah yeah well at

888
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,089
least makes sense but to be punished

889
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:04,219
because you have your act together and

890
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,350
you're a good person that's real

891
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:09,559
punishment and that's what happens to

892
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:11,630
Harry so luckily he finds out that he's

893
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,929
magical which is quite convenient and

894
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,809
off he goes to Wizarding school and you

895
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,460
know that's actually like taking that's

896
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:22,250
actually like going and studying the

897
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:26,840
humanities I mean it was when they still

898
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:30,949
were you know because you it's through

899
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,930
the humanities that you that you make

900
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:36,409
contact with the magic of your culture

901
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:39,230
and that makes you more than merely the

902
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:40,579
child of your parents because you are

903
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,260
more than merely the child of your

904
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,199
parents you're the child of nature and

905
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,110
you're the child of culture and until

906
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,909
you understand what that means

907
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,980
understand that you have two sets of

908
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:54,730
parents like the divine hero always has

909
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,500
two sets of parents you you can't

910
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,869
construe yourself properly as an

911
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,610
individual you're not situated properly

912
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:04,039
in the world you don't know what your

913
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,230
responsibilities are you can't orient

914
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,369
your values properly and you will suffer

915
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:14,360
for that because as far as I can tell

916
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:15,230
because life is so difficult you have to

917
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,130
do something that's

918
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:22,460
truly worthwhile in order to justify it

919
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:23,840
and so well that's what all these

920
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,909
stories tell you that's what the story

921
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,880
of Jonah is telling you it's like you

922
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:33,108
have an ethical duty to straighten

923
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:37,280
things up and if you don't do it you're

924
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:38,960
gonna be sorry and that stories echoed

925
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,910
everywhere while now st. George

926
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,099
well let's go to Harry Potter well

927
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:45,769
that's what we were talking about so he

928
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:48,108
goes off to the Magic Castle and he's

929
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:50,269
learning to be a wizard and he's kind of

930
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:53,269
an interesting character a because he's

931
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:55,449
not really good and we find out I think

932
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:58,759
that's because does he have a piece of

933
00:40:55,449 --> 00:41:03,009
gold amarti in him he's not what happens

934
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,869
yeah and that's what that means is that

935
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,700
to be good

936
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:09,619
truly good you can't just follow rules

937
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,779
that's that's very clear in the Harry

938
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:13,490
Potter story and you also have to be

939
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,800
able to understand and malevolence and

940
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:17,779
in order to understand malevolence so

941
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,920
that you can withstand it you have to

942
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,650
understand that part of you that's

943
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,380
malevolent because if you don't you're

944
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:27,800
naive and if you're naive you're easy

945
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,960
pickings and so that's a union idea too

946
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,760
and the Union idea is that part of

947
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,000
personality development is to understand

948
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,760
your shadow and the shadow is those

949
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,289
things about you that you do not want to

950
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,359
admit to and you can learn about your

951
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:47,059
shadow by reading history you know you

952
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:49,489
can read about Auschwitz you can read

953
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:54,849
about the concentration camps in Russia

954
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:58,789
and you can imagine yourself as a guard

955
00:41:54,849 --> 00:42:01,429
instead of as a heroic rescuer of

956
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:05,420
unfortunate victims which would be very

957
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:06,799
very unlikely and once you can imagine

958
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,269
yourself as a guard which is a

959
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,570
terrifying thing to do then you

960
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:16,219
understand something about yourself and

961
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,010
I actually think and I think this is

962
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:20,689
also from students studying young that

963
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,340
you cannot have proper respect for

964
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,400
yourself until you know that you're a

965
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,960
monster because you won't act carefully

966
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,880
enough you know if you think well I'm a

967
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,608
nice person I'd never do anyone any harm

968
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,309
it's like you're no saint you can be

969
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:37,338
sure of that and the harm that you do

970
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:39,729
people can come in many many ways and so

971
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:45,078
if you regard yourself as harmless

972
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:46,399
inoffensive nice well why do you have

973
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:48,349
any reason to be careful

974
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,690
you're like a teddy bear sitting on a

975
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:51,528
shelf even if you throw it at someone no

976
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,150
one's gonna get hurt

977
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,768
but that isn't what you're like because

978
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:59,389
you're a human being and human beings

979
00:42:54,768 --> 00:43:01,459
are some vicious creatures and there's

980
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:03,858
utility in knowing that because it's

981
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,329
also the case you know in the Harry

982
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:06,679
Potter series Harry could stand up

983
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,059
against full-dome art and understand

984
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,940
them and speak his language because he

985
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:13,609
was infected by him to some degree a

986
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:16,130
very very interesting idea anyways in

987
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:17,690
the second 10 the reason I'm telling you

988
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,720
this and this is worth thinking about

989
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:25,099
it's like how long were each of those

990
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:28,578
books like 500 pages they're long eh and

991
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:30,829
there was how many of them seven and how

992
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:34,450
many of them were sold I mean how many

993
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:34,450
of you read every Harry Potter book

994
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:41,298
right that's how many of you read at

995
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:44,088
least one okay how many you saw the

996
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:48,288
movies it's like you're all in a cult

997
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:52,190
you are I'm telling you really that's

998
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:54,200
the truth it's really the truth so in

999
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,670
the second volume there's this snake

1000
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,848
that's zip it around there the basilisk

1001
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:01,940
right and it lives in the underground

1002
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:03,798
that's chaos that's chaos and that's

1003
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,539
because wherever you are you're on thin

1004
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:08,210
ice and underneath you're thin ice is

1005
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:10,339
chaos and here we are in this

1006
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,710
unbelievably civilized environment and

1007
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:15,858
everyone's getting along so perfectly

1008
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:18,289
but you know we've got hot guard lights

1009
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:21,978
with electricity the sewage system is

1010
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:24,559
working no one's hungry it's like we can

1011
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:26,629
be peaceful but if any of that fell

1012
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,099
apart and it could easily fall apart

1013
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:32,749
because it's a bloody miracle it ever

1014
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:34,219
works at all then the chaos that's just

1015
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:37,009
underneath the surface is going to come

1016
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:39,380
up right now and it's useful to know

1017
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:41,900
that because it makes you properly

1018
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,740
grateful if you really understand it it

1019
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,869
makes you proper

1020
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:47,889
be grateful for the bloody miracle that

1021
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:50,390
it is that you can be here in peace

1022
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:52,009
so anyways there's this snake that's

1023
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:55,099
underneath the surface and it's you know

1024
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,740
no joke that thing it's big and it's

1025
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:01,940
ancient it's always been there and what

1026
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:04,699
happens if you look at it it turns you

1027
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,530
to stone right it paralyzes you well

1028
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:09,769
that's the more that's the Gorgon that's

1029
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,900
Medusa the woman with the head of snakes

1030
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:15,380
and if you look at her it paralyzes you

1031
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,210
what does that mean well you're walking

1032
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,690
through the jungle and big snake appears

1033
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:23,389
what do you do you freeze and no bloody

1034
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,860
wonder because you're a prey animal and

1035
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:28,789
that's what they do when they see things

1036
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:32,059
that are going to eat them and so the

1037
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:37,519
snake well lots of people still die from

1038
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:39,860
snakebite and our ancestors were and I

1039
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,509
mean our ancestors like you know tens of

1040
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,890
millions of years ago when they were

1041
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,080
living in trees and weren't very big

1042
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:47,150
they made a nice snack for a snake and

1043
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,460
there's a woman named Lynn Isbell who's

1044
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,369
an anthropologist at UCLA who's

1045
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,760
correlated the presence of carnivorous

1046
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:57,980
snakes with the acuity of primate vision

1047
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,960
and what she found was that the more

1048
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,429
snakes around the better the primates

1049
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,070
could see so and we're particularly good

1050
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:08,089
at picking up patterns like snake

1051
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,010
camouflage in the lower half of our

1052
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,210
visual quadrant you know and people

1053
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,090
generally don't like snakes you can

1054
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,949
learn to handle them but no snake fear

1055
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,840
appears to be an eight to Nate in

1056
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:19,669
chimpanzees and it tends to increase as

1057
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,430
you age rather than decreasing you can

1058
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,680
overcome it but well my daughter had

1059
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:28,759
snakes and one day her snake bit her it

1060
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:30,379
was a fairly big snake and she hadn't

1061
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,820
paid attention to it for a while so it

1062
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:36,950
nailed her and from then on she had very

1063
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,630
difficult time grabbing the snake it was

1064
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:43,730
like bitten once you know shy

1065
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,858
permanently she also told me years later

1066
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,420
she had nightmares about snakes all the

1067
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:49,670
time when she had a snake in her room

1068
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:54,829
it's like you know and I think it was

1069
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:56,659
probably the smell so anyways so Harry

1070
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:58,098
Potter decides he's going to go

1071
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:59,690
after the basilisk rake he's gonna go

1072
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:03,349
out there and face the thing that he's

1073
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,900
most afraid of so he does that wait out

1074
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:08,599
in the depths so it's like Jonah going

1075
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:12,680
down into the depths and he faces the

1076
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:15,019
basilisk and it bites him and you know

1077
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:18,108
that's a that's right because if you go

1078
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:20,780
down into the depths you can get bitten

1079
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:22,548
like it's no joke and this is a hero

1080
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,140
story but the thing about the hero

1081
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,940
stories it's actually real the thing

1082
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:28,730
that you're facing is actually dangerous

1083
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,579
and even though facing it voluntarily

1084
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,349
might be your best bet and is likely

1085
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:35,329
your best bet because that's the central

1086
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:37,730
story of humanity that doesn't mean

1087
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:40,130
you're going to succeed it's the real

1088
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:42,559
thing so anyways he gets bitten right

1089
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,440
and he's gonna die now he's rescuing

1090
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,829
Ginny so that's the st. George story if

1091
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,750
you go after like dragon dragons like to

1092
00:47:48,829 --> 00:48:01,670
capture virgins god only knows why I

1093
00:47:52,750 --> 00:48:04,099
think it's because I think it's because

1094
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,769
one of the things that male humans have

1095
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:10,039
done from the beginning of time is chase

1096
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:14,809
the damn predators away and I suspect

1097
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:17,329
that the males from god only knows how

1098
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:21,559
long ago who were particularly good at

1099
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:25,579
that were rewarded with female attention

1100
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:28,579
and why the hell not so it's deeply

1101
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:30,829
rooted inside of us that idea of facing

1102
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:33,079
the unknown and freeing the woman so the

1103
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:35,839
idea there is that if you it's a male

1104
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,450
idea and in large part I can talk about

1105
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,909
the central female myth and I will as we

1106
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:45,169
proceed the idea is that if you're this

1107
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:47,269
sort of person who can stand up against

1108
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,818
the unknown and the frightening then

1109
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:50,989
you're also likely if you develop into

1110
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:52,548
that sort of person then you're also

1111
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:54,199
likely to develop into the sort of

1112
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:58,519
person that other people will find

1113
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:00,230
attractive so you know and that's why

1114
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,420
young believed that the inside the

1115
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,519
shadow was the anima which is like a

1116
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,130
female figure and so his idea was

1117
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:08,929
something like you know if you look

1118
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,608
watch movies there's always this beta

1119
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:12,139
male guy if there

1120
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:14,179
romantic movies and he's a nice guy and

1121
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:15,498
he's the friend and you know the woman

1122
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:17,568
tells him everything but she doesn't

1123
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:20,719
like him a bit she likes the guy who's

1124
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:23,650
like God an edge and and who's capable

1125
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:26,929
of I would say mayhem but at least of

1126
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:28,730
aggression now that doesn't mean she

1127
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:30,139
wants them to be aggressive but what it

1128
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,420
does mean is that she wants him to be

1129
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:35,179
able to be aggressive that would be good

1130
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,950
and so he's the romantic target and so

1131
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:39,618
he's the person that's incorporated the

1132
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:42,909
shadow and he's someone that is

1133
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:46,720
respectable and perhaps useful and so

1134
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:46,719
well that's a very old story

1135
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:02,710
so let's let's think about this for a

1136
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,260
minute I've already offered you a

1137
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,190
proposition

1138
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,080
and I think it's an important

1139
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:10,599
proposition and I'm I'm offering you

1140
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,299
this proposition so that you can make

1141
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,630
sense of art and literature and

1142
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:19,300
mythology and religion and dance and all

1143
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:22,090
those strange ritualistic things that

1144
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:26,860
human beings do which seem central to us

1145
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:31,470
including including not least the in

1146
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:35,370
eradicable tendency of us to seek out

1147
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:39,009
stories of heroes I should finish the

1148
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:41,859
Harry Potter story so Harry Potter goes

1149
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:44,850
down there to rescue Virginia no it's

1150
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,470
that's not her name what is it

1151
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:50,319
Ginny yeah but there's a there's a

1152
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:51,699
formal name for that it's a variant of

1153
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,530
Virginia anyways which is a very

1154
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:58,629
divergent so um and it gets bitten

1155
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:01,750
didn't yes Ginevra that's it he gets

1156
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:04,630
bitten and the bite is poison and so

1157
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:07,210
there is dying which doesn't seem to be

1158
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:09,099
so good and then what happens and again

1159
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:12,460
you guys swallow this it's no problem

1160
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:15,909
so what's his name the Dumbledore

1161
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:18,039
character he's got a bird right so he's

1162
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:19,839
the wise old man he's the ruler of the

1163
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:23,529
castle he's the ruler of the Magic

1164
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,780
Castle he's the Magic King you know he's

1165
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,760
like God the Father as far as Harry

1166
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,640
Potter is concerned and he has a bird

1167
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,890
what kind of bird is it it's a Phoenix

1168
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,379
right and one of the things that's very

1169
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:37,839
strange about a Phoenix is that well

1170
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,730
it's immortal but in a strange way you

1171
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,140
know it lives and lives I think a

1172
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,940
hundred years and it gets older and

1173
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,339
older and then one day poof it bursts

1174
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:48,550
into flames and turns into an egg and

1175
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,670
then you get a new Phoenix so that's a

1176
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,890
symbol of transformation it's a symbol

1177
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:58,090
of transformation the bird is a spirit

1178
00:51:53,889 --> 00:52:02,199
or psyche and so here's what it means in

1179
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:03,579
part you know you know how when you

1180
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:06,069
learn a lesson in your life that that's

1181
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:09,199
not very pleasant right it's not like

1182
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:13,309
when you learn something important it's

1183
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:15,169
best day of your life it's often the

1184
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,329
importance of what you learn is often

1185
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,280
proportionate to just how wretched it is

1186
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:21,230
to learn it you know you learn things

1187
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,800
the hard way you learn things by getting

1188
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:26,420
hit because obviously if what you're

1189
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,640
doing is working you get where you want

1190
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,530
there's no learning in that and that's

1191
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,619
happy it's when you're doing something

1192
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:35,240
and you hit an obstacle and maybe yeah

1193
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:37,190
bloody well hit it hard and then you

1194
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:38,599
know you recoil and then you down into

1195
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,519
the depths you go and you have to sort

1196
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,409
yourself out and you realize that you're

1197
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:44,480
you know this particular kind of idiot

1198
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,250
and that you should probably fix that

1199
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,619
and that's really annoying and difficult

1200
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,119
and you know and maybe you're down in

1201
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:51,920
the dumps and anxious for quite a while

1202
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,420
and then you get it repaired more or

1203
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,930
less and you know you put yourself back

1204
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,519
together

1205
00:52:53,929 --> 00:53:03,739
that's the Phoenix poof into flames bang

1206
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:06,320
egg new you and so you know that's the

1207
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:08,149
ability to learn now human beings are

1208
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,510
very strange creatures right because

1209
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:13,519
we're very malleable compared to most

1210
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:15,830
animals you know like grizzly bears now

1211
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,199
and grizzly bears a thousand years ago

1212
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:20,889
it's like whatever they're the same

1213
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:23,839
thing they do the same thing

1214
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:25,969
there's no transformation about human

1215
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,700
beings we have this massive brain and

1216
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:30,379
you know it's a pain because it means

1217
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:34,669
you have to take care of human children

1218
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:37,160
until they're 40 and and that's a big

1219
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,780
burden and so you know we pay a big

1220
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:42,289
price for it it also makes childbirth

1221
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,730
very difficult and and it's costly you

1222
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:45,320
have to eat a lot because you have a big

1223
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:48,889
brain because it uses up a lot of energy

1224
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:51,590
and so you know you pay a price for it

1225
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:54,949
but the advantage is your plastic you

1226
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:57,950
can learn now learning is a strange

1227
00:53:54,949 --> 00:54:01,399
thing because you can think of it as

1228
00:53:57,949 --> 00:54:03,079
just acquiring more information but you

1229
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,920
could also think of it and this is more

1230
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:08,840
accurate as finding out something that

1231
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,460
you're doing wrong so that's sort of

1232
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,350
built into you like a character a

1233
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,389
character element of your character a

1234
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:16,849
presumption of your perception or a deep

1235
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:18,980
habit it's really built into you it's a

1236
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:22,369
neural structure right it's a little

1237
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,940
I've and you have to kill it because it

1238
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:25,460
isn't working

1239
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,929
properly and the pain that you go

1240
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,048
through in part when you're suffering

1241
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:33,669
because you did something stupid is it's

1242
00:54:30,048 --> 00:54:36,949
something like your your the neurology I

1243
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:39,530
can never get this quite right it's the

1244
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:41,989
pain of the death of that structure and

1245
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,940
that could be a huge chunk of you you

1246
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:47,989
know if you really have to go through a

1247
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:49,220
massive revision it's like the person

1248
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,750
that comes out the other end might

1249
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,939
hardly be the same at all

1250
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,789
you know that happens for example if

1251
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:58,068
you're trying to combat alcoholism which

1252
00:54:55,789 --> 00:55:01,039
is just you know a wretched thing to do

1253
00:54:58,068 --> 00:55:03,500
because well all your friends are

1254
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:05,210
alcoholic all your family drinks too

1255
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,039
much the only thing you know how to do

1256
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,318
when you're socializing is to go to the

1257
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:12,020
bar and drink too much you know and you

1258
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:14,750
spend like 20 hours a week on it it's

1259
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:16,909
like it's not just that you're addicted

1260
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,798
to the substance it's like that's how

1261
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:19,969
you live and so if you want to stop

1262
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,889
being an alcoholic

1263
00:55:19,969 --> 00:55:24,679
not only do you have to stop drinking

1264
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:26,719
alcohol but you have to stop seeing all

1265
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:28,608
your drunk friends and then maybe you've

1266
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,230
had them for your whole life and you

1267
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:32,269
have to have continual battles with your

1268
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:34,039
drunk family and then you have to figure

1269
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:36,349
out something to do with that 20 hours

1270
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:40,220
that's now like hanging around your neck

1271
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:42,170
like an albatross and so you have to let

1272
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:45,588
that whole part of your personality die

1273
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:48,440
and a new part has to spring forth and

1274
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:50,558
that's what the Phoenix is and the

1275
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,798
Phoenix is the capacity of the person to

1276
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:59,119
transform and so when Harry gets bit by

1277
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:00,920
the snake that freezes him he gets

1278
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,548
seriously injured the Phoenix comes in

1279
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:09,309
Christ some tears in his wound it

1280
00:56:04,548 --> 00:56:13,880
prepares him bang he's back to life and

1281
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:17,089
the strange thing is that that's okay

1282
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:19,849
with all of the viewers now why would

1283
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:24,858
that be there's nothing about it that's

1284
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:28,068
rational nothing right Magic Castle

1285
00:56:24,858 --> 00:56:30,380
that's not rational giant snake

1286
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:32,300
underneath it that's a little more

1287
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:35,220
irrational

1288
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:37,650
turning you to stone going down there to

1289
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:39,179
face it being rejuvenated by a Phoenix

1290
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,070
it's like yeah yeah that's okay we can

1291
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:42,899
we'll watch that clue

1292
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,490
well swallow it will be completely

1293
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,250
engaged in it and the reason for that is

1294
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:50,819
because it's a myth it's about how

1295
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:52,559
people it's a meta story about how to

1296
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,390
act about how to conduct yourself in the

1297
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,250
world to face the things that you're

1298
00:56:54,389 --> 00:57:01,250
afraid of that would otherwise paralyze

1299
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:04,769
you to let the death of what is

1300
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:08,630
insufficient about you occur and then to

1301
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:08,630
wait for the rebirth

1302
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:21,690
okay so science is about what the world

1303
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:25,230
is and myth and drama and dream and the

1304
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:28,108
unconscious all of that let's say the

1305
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:30,630
aesthetic and artistic and fantastic

1306
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:33,119
side of humanity that's more about how

1307
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:36,030
things should be it's more about how to

1308
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,309
act they're there lessons in how to act

1309
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:40,830
and they're abstract lessons people are

1310
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:42,809
capable of abstraction right so you say

1311
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:44,250
well there's something good about you

1312
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:45,570
and there's something good about you and

1313
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,309
there's something good about you and and

1314
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,900
there's some bad about you and you and

1315
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:50,369
you and so we'll take all the good

1316
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,780
things and make one good thing out of

1317
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:53,519
that we'll take all the bad things and

1318
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,810
make one bad thing out of that and then

1319
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,670
we sort understand the difference

1320
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:58,259
between good and bad and we get better

1321
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,389
and better and better and better at that

1322
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:02,310
over the centuries as we distill that

1323
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:03,989
and then we have a figure of ultimate

1324
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:06,570
good and a figure of ultimate evil and

1325
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:09,929
that helps us understand what those two

1326
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:11,100
things are those are the hostile

1327
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:13,319
brothers that's a very common

1328
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:17,549
mythological motif and you could say

1329
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:21,690
well they're at war inside you and and I

1330
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:24,769
think that that's a universal truth it's

1331
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:24,769
an existential truth

1332
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:31,940
the domain of ethics and morality is how

1333
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:34,068
are we in the world and what how should

1334
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,809
we be what's the good and the reason I'm

1335
00:58:34,068 --> 00:58:37,130
telling you all this apart from the fact

1336
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,719
that you should know it because this is

1337
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,420
what you should know if you go through

1338
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,389
university is that it bears directly on

1339
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,920
issues of health you're trying to

1340
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:47,478
accomplish something say if you go see a

1341
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,338
psychotherapist you know you could say

1342
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:51,048
well I'm trying to get healthy but you

1343
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:52,429
know that's not really right what you're

1344
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:53,989
trying to do when you go see your

1345
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:56,419
therapist just get your life together

1346
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:59,989
and that's not the same thing you know

1347
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:01,729
like mostly when I'm acting as a

1348
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:04,099
therapist it's not like I'm directly

1349
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:06,108
treating mental disorder like mental

1350
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:08,269
disorders aren't there just not neat

1351
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:10,818
little boxes it's not like someone has a

1352
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:13,068
fully functioning life but they have an

1353
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:14,358
anxiety disorder and then you bring them

1354
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:15,889
and you treat the anxiety disorder and

1355
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:17,358
they go back to their fully functioning

1356
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:19,969
life it's like it's not like that at all

1357
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,588
the disorder is tangled out into their

1358
00:59:19,969 --> 00:59:23,989
life you know if you're depressed

1359
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:25,338
well usually your your workplace isn't

1360
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:26,749
going very well and your relationships

1361
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:29,239
with the people around you are damaged

1362
00:59:26,748 --> 00:59:31,759
and you know you're connected in the

1363
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:33,889
actual world with all of these things

1364
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:36,199
and so when you come to see a therapist

1365
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:38,028
you have to work on putting your life

1366
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:40,940
together in a sustainable manner and

1367
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:43,518
that's certainly not just removing the

1368
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,650
mental illness is very rare now and then

1369
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:47,328
you see someone who's depressed whose

1370
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,099
life is together and they're just

1371
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:52,640
depressed something's gone wrong

1372
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:53,930
probably biochemically and so with

1373
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,078
someone like that you can often give

1374
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:59,058
them in SSRIs I can't give them to them

1375
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:02,839
but I can recommend them recommend they

1376
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:05,028
go see a doctor anyways and that

1377
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,858
sometimes just does the trick because

1378
01:00:05,028 --> 01:00:08,690
you know their life is actually pretty

1379
01:00:06,858 --> 01:00:10,880
good they just can't see it but that's

1380
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,409
bloody rare man it's usually the case

1381
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,539
that someone comes and sees you and

1382
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:17,179
things are in a serious state of chaos

1383
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:19,819
and all of that has to be addressed and

1384
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:21,618
some of its psychological and a lot of

1385
01:00:19,818 --> 01:00:23,958
it's just practical its embedded out

1386
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:25,969
there in the world that's what the

1387
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:27,739
behavior cycle behavioral psychologists

1388
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:30,048
are particularly concerned about so

1389
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:33,528
anyways psychology especially the

1390
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:36,259
clinical end is predicated on it's

1391
01:00:33,528 --> 01:00:38,208
necessarily predicated on the question

1392
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:39,409
how is it that we obtain the good how do

1393
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:41,000
we aim at the good and what would that

1394
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:42,649
be when my clients for

1395
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,840
come to see me one of the things I often

1396
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:47,090
ask them is okay well let's say you look

1397
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,100
a year ahead what do you want what are

1398
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,600
we aiming at what would what wouldn't

1399
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,059
your life isn't the way you want it to

1400
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,949
be how would it look if it was the way

1401
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:58,369
you wanted it to be or at least partly

1402
01:00:54,949 --> 01:01:01,639
that way and we aim at that right we

1403
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:04,250
look for impediments psychological

1404
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:06,920
impediments fears avoidance strategies

1405
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:09,289
that sort of thing and we develop

1406
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:14,570
strategies and we try to move towards

1407
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:18,920
that I would say ideal all right to

1408
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:20,630
understand the categories of myth we'll

1409
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,480
say you we have to understand something

1410
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:25,760
about the nature of categorization now

1411
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,269
categorization is a tricky thing and

1412
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:34,640
we're gonna run through some complicated

1413
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:36,440
ideas relatively quickly you know you

1414
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:40,190
think you put things in the same

1415
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:42,500
category because they're similar but the

1416
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:44,990
problem is is that first of all that's

1417
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:47,690
not an answer it's just a restatement of

1418
01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:50,599
the initial proposition and second of

1419
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:52,519
all you can put things in the same

1420
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:55,579
category that are by no means identical

1421
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:57,829
and you often do that and third it's

1422
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:01,569
things are things that are similar are

1423
01:01:57,829 --> 01:02:05,299
often also importantly different and so

1424
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:07,250
picking which element of similarity you

1425
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,140
know like let's say oh if you have a

1426
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:12,440
group of books well are they the same

1427
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:15,309
well obviously no because well unless

1428
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,720
they're you know all the same book but

1429
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:19,519
the category of books is a pretty

1430
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:21,319
strange category because the content of

1431
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,880
the books differs completely well you

1432
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,550
could still make a group of books and

1433
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,610
you pick some arbitrary element that

1434
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:31,610
unites them and consider that grounds to

1435
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:33,530
make a category there's other categories

1436
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:36,530
more scientific categories and

1437
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:38,060
scientific categories tend to actually

1438
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:40,670
contain things that are very very

1439
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:43,369
similar in across multiple dimensions

1440
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,389
like protons are like that as far as I

1441
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:46,069
can tell there's nothing that

1442
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:48,739
distinguishes one proton from another

1443
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:50,600
and the same with electrons and you know

1444
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:52,849
the set of triangles is like that

1445
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:54,860
because you can define it precisely but

1446
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:57,349
most of the categories that human

1447
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:59,630
Jews aren't so neat and the problem with

1448
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:01,579
that is that unless the categories are

1449
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:04,340
neat like scientific categories it's

1450
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:07,009
very difficult to investigate them

1451
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,200
scientifically so for example you might

1452
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:12,560
do research on a group of people with

1453
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:15,230
anxiety disorders but the problem with

1454
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,949
that is that the anxiety disorder

1455
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:22,369
category is so heterogeneous that it's

1456
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:24,649
almost impossible to identify the

1457
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:26,089
commonalities across all the people who

1458
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:27,860
are in that category and that's partly

1459
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,840
because the category isn't actually a

1460
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:32,990
scientific category it's a hybrid

1461
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:36,130
category it's a practical category I can

1462
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:36,129
give you an example of that

1463
01:03:54,489 --> 01:04:00,459
no I can't because I must not have saved

1464
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:02,289
it anyways many of the DSM categories so

1465
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,679
these are categories for psychopathology

1466
01:04:02,289 --> 01:04:07,630
require if you're part of that category

1467
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,159
imagine there's seven symptoms that you

1468
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,390
could have or eight symptoms that you

1469
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:12,339
could have that would put you in that

1470
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:15,819
category like antisocial personality

1471
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,980
eight symptoms you steal you kick you

1472
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:20,800
hit you bite you you know you're abusive

1473
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:23,380
I don't remember the category categories

1474
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,180
precisely but you can be in the category

1475
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,619
if you have symptoms two through five

1476
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:28,419
and you can be in the category if you

1477
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:30,309
have symptoms six through eight they

1478
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,200
aren't the same symptoms but you're in

1479
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:34,210
the same category and you think well how

1480
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:36,250
the hell can that be well that's a

1481
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,199
family resemblance category roughly

1482
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:40,059
speaking and lots of the things that we

1483
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:42,519
use our family resemblance categories

1484
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:44,500
there's a prototype and then if you have

1485
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:46,360
enough of the features of that prototype

1486
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,480
imagine the prototype has ten features

1487
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:51,970
and if you have an six of it those pro

1488
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,829
features you get to be in that category

1489
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:55,719
but it means that the categories are

1490
01:04:53,829 --> 01:05:00,039
actually quite diverse and that's one of

1491
01:04:55,719 --> 01:05:01,959
the problems that plagues psycho

1492
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:03,699
psychiatry as a science in clinical

1493
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,039
psychology as a science it's a really

1494
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:08,049
big problem because if the categories

1495
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:10,239
aren't homogeneous then it's very

1496
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:12,460
difficult to draw conclusions about the

1497
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,858
members of the category and the

1498
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,119
psychologists and the psychiatrist's

1499
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:19,059
claim that those are scientific

1500
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,650
categories but but they're not and they

1501
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:23,139
can't be partly because they're aimed at

1502
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,090
the classification of health or ideal

1503
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:26,679
versus non health or non-ideal and

1504
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:30,460
partly because they play multiple roles

1505
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:33,460
say I mean the category isn't there just

1506
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,579
to provide neat demarcations for

1507
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:39,429
scientific study the categories there to

1508
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:42,009
give people a language to talk about

1509
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:43,960
certain sets of symptoms to diagnose

1510
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,220
because you know when you come in and

1511
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,108
you have a set of symptoms you might

1512
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:49,269
want to know what what they are so that

1513
01:05:47,108 --> 01:05:51,789
you also know what they aren't it's

1514
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:53,530
really a relief often to find a

1515
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:55,300
diagnosis and then of course the

1516
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,940
diagnosis has certain implications for

1517
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:59,560
treatment and and for billing and for

1518
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,630
all of that so the category has to play

1519
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:05,739
all of those roles so there's multiple

1520
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:08,170
types of category and the categories

1521
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:08,409
that were talking about in relationship

1522
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:11,530
to

1523
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:13,649
ecology aren't scientific categories

1524
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:19,780
they're categories about the world

1525
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:22,720
construed as a place to act so here's a

1526
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,950
way to think about it you're always

1527
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,379
looking at the world through a framework

1528
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:29,739
of reference and you have to do that

1529
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:31,480
because there isn't very much of you you

1530
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:33,129
can't see the whole world at once and in

1531
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,960
fact the amount of the world you

1532
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:36,789
actually see is so small you can't

1533
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,500
believe it the central part of your

1534
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:40,900
vision is zipping around producing a

1535
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,110
pretty high-resolution representation of

1536
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:46,150
exactly what you're looking at but

1537
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:48,820
outside of that center like if I look at

1538
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:52,289
you I can't see her eyes I can see her

1539
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:56,740
glasses but barely I can't even tell

1540
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:59,559
whether you're male or female the person

1541
01:06:56,739 --> 01:07:01,989
past that I can't see it all now you

1542
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:03,579
don't notice that you know you don't

1543
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:05,739
notice that you're that blind because

1544
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:07,869
you're your central vision is always

1545
01:07:05,739 --> 01:07:10,269
popping around illuminating that tiny

1546
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:12,699
space but you're so damn blind it's just

1547
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:14,800
mind-boggling and I'm sure some of you

1548
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:18,279
have seen the invisible gorilla video

1549
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,650
you know where a gorilla comes into the

1550
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,120
video and you don't notice which is

1551
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,829
somewhat shocking because you would

1552
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,869
think that you would notice a gorilla

1553
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:28,179
but what happens is that you actually

1554
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:30,449
don't notice something unless it

1555
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:32,409
interferes with what you're doing and

1556
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:35,199
because what are you gonna do notice

1557
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:36,759
everything you can't do that you can

1558
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:38,349
hardly notice anything so what you do is

1559
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,030
you pick something to focus on it's

1560
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:41,829
usually something that you value because

1561
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,350
why else would you focus on it so that

1562
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:47,920
means that your value system determines

1563
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:49,659
the direction of your perception bloody

1564
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,990
well think about that for a minute

1565
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:55,559
that's a Buddhist idea right people

1566
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:57,639
people live in a kind of illusion and

1567
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:59,230
sometimes that illusion causes suffering

1568
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:00,639
and they can transform the way they look

1569
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:02,650
at the world and that can release them

1570
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,139
from their suffering but the idea that

1571
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,210
you do live in an illusion well I don't

1572
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:10,509
know if it's exactly an illusion but you

1573
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:12,429
certainly do live within a framework of

1574
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:15,340
perception that's determined by your

1575
01:08:12,429 --> 01:08:17,079
values now that is so weird you know

1576
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,000
because we never think of the world as

1577
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:22,359
something that reveals itself through

1578
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:26,380
our values but of course it of course it

1579
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:28,630
because you look at what you want you

1580
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,909
aim at what you want and once you've

1581
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,800
aimed the world lays itself out for you

1582
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:35,050
and that's exactly how perception works

1583
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,909
that's why I represented it this way

1584
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:39,430
you're always somewhere that's point a

1585
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:42,369
that's somewhere in some place and some

1586
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:43,720
time and you always have some notion

1587
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:46,210
about what you want to have have

1588
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,859
happened next you know you're gonna go

1589
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:50,140
to the next class maybe you've got a

1590
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:52,329
plan after this in this class you have a

1591
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:54,640
plan you're hoping to learn something I

1592
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:56,380
presume and maybe you have a goal with

1593
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,570
regards to a grade and that's nested

1594
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:00,670
inside your desire to get a degree and

1595
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:02,529
that's nested inside your desire to be

1596
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:05,670
educated and to have a career and and

1597
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:09,159
and and have a successful life so

1598
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:10,510
attending to me at the moment the reason

1599
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:12,338
you're doing that is because all of

1600
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:14,530
those values exist within you

1601
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:18,369
simultaneously focusing your attention

1602
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:20,619
and so you're attending to me and not to

1603
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:22,869
something else assuming that all of you

1604
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:26,140
with your computers open aren't surfing

1605
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:29,380
the web which you might be but assuming

1606
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:31,060
that you're focusing whatever you're

1607
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,980
focusing on is directed by what you

1608
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,350
value and some of that can be

1609
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:37,119
unconscious in fact a lot of it is

1610
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,920
unconscious because you know it's very

1611
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,599
difficult for you to get control of what

1612
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,730
you pay attention to you know what

1613
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,609
that's like you're trying to study it's

1614
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:47,349
kind of a boring paper christ' your

1615
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:49,300
attention it's just like everywhere you

1616
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:51,130
know maybe you'll vacuum under the bed

1617
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,710
instead of doing the Pape reading the

1618
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:55,449
paper you know you can't get a grip on

1619
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:57,460
that thing so your attention has an

1620
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:59,409
autonomy and that's another

1621
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,819
psychoanalytic idea you know because you

1622
01:09:59,409 --> 01:10:02,769
kind of think well you're in control

1623
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:04,809
it's like really

1624
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:07,420
you ever try telling yourself what to do

1625
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:09,160
does the how does that work for you I'm

1626
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:12,970
going to go to the gym three times a

1627
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:16,840
week right sure heard you who are ya I'm

1628
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:18,789
gonna quit eating sugar for a month it's

1629
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,619
like how long does that lasts like 15

1630
01:10:18,789 --> 01:10:24,279
minutes and you're eating like three

1631
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:25,930
chocolate bars so you're this is and

1632
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:29,460
this is Freud central insight I would

1633
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:32,470
say you're an autonomous group of

1634
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,449
spiritual agents let's say personalities

1635
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:36,219
and they don't really get along very

1636
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:39,399
well and

1637
01:10:36,219 --> 01:10:42,368
you the ego will say is by no means

1638
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:44,170
necessarily in charge and that's a very

1639
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:46,118
strange thing to realize but you can

1640
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:47,440
really realize that by noticing how

1641
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:50,978
little control you have over your

1642
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:53,319
attentional focus okay so you've got

1643
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:55,570
your point a you're going to point B

1644
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:58,448
you're always doing that you inhabit a

1645
01:10:55,569 --> 01:10:59,978
structure of value and it changes what

1646
01:10:58,448 --> 01:11:01,569
the point a is and what the point B is

1647
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:03,909
but the structure itself doesn't change

1648
01:11:01,569 --> 01:11:06,609
when you're looking at the world what

1649
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:08,379
you see is not objects you see tools and

1650
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:09,998
they make you happy those are things

1651
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,859
that facilitate your movement forward

1652
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:13,538
and you see obstacles and those are

1653
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:16,149
things that make you unhappy and when

1654
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:18,009
you encounter in an obstacle one of the

1655
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:19,420
problems is as well you don't get to

1656
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:21,070
where you're going and that's a problem

1657
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:23,469
but the other problem is if you

1658
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:25,630
encounter an obstacle the frame might be

1659
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:26,889
wrong right because you never know it

1660
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:29,260
might be just something that you could

1661
01:11:26,889 --> 01:11:31,989
Ditu around real easily might be a fatal

1662
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:34,780
flaw in your whole plan and so obstacles

1663
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:36,819
have this dual nature they get in your

1664
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:39,609
way but they can also take your plan

1665
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:41,948
down and so they can produce anxiety so

1666
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:45,308
my point is and this there's a book

1667
01:11:41,948 --> 01:11:49,439
called visual an ecological approach to

1668
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:52,769
visual perceptions great book by Gibson

1669
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:56,518
JJ Gibson if I remember correctly and

1670
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:59,380
this is although I thought of this a

1671
01:11:56,519 --> 01:12:01,840
while back I realized eventually that it

1672
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,429
was a variant of his theory and when he

1673
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,369
believed was that when people looked at

1674
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:09,190
the world they saw a value first and an

1675
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:11,618
inferred object second so for example

1676
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:14,138
for Gibson if you're standing by a cliff

1677
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:16,029
you don't see a cliff and then think

1678
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:18,670
about the fact that you might fall and

1679
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:21,340
then feel frightened you see a falling

1680
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:23,590
off place and part of the seeing of that

1681
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:25,300
part of the act of seeing is being

1682
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,860
afraid of that because your eyes are

1683
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,380
connected right to your emotional

1684
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:31,509
systems and part of what your eyes do is

1685
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:33,190
tell you what the object is but your

1686
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:35,199
eyes do all sorts of other things like

1687
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:37,210
they prepare you for action they prepare

1688
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,879
you for gripping they prepare you for

1689
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:43,510
emotion and and none of that actually

1690
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,519
requires the the existence necessarily

1691
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:46,989
the existence of your perception of the

1692
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:49,960
object so there are people who have

1693
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:51,669
blind sight and if you show them so they

1694
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,680
think they can't see but if you flash

1695
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:56,289
them in angry face they'll show a skin

1696
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,239
conductance response and that's because

1697
01:12:56,289 --> 01:13:00,670
the visual pathways to the amygdala

1698
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,859
which does face a most facial emotional

1699
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:04,420
processing can still be active these are

1700
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:05,500
people who've usually had a stroke so

1701
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:10,539
their eyes are okay but they've

1702
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:12,520
destroyed the visual cortex so so

1703
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:14,199
anyways it's perfectly plausible that at

1704
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,510
least at one level of analysis when you

1705
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:19,210
look at something you see it's utility

1706
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:21,400
first so you see a chair and you might

1707
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:24,460
say a chair is an object but I wouldn't

1708
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:26,349
say that beanbags a chair and a stump is

1709
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,239
a chair and they don't share much in

1710
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:30,700
common except that you can sit on them

1711
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:33,609
and so you know the chair is just the

1712
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:35,738
chair is basically conceptualized by its

1713
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:37,599
functional utility and when you look at

1714
01:13:35,738 --> 01:13:39,549
a chair what you perceive its is its

1715
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,329
functional utility and the chair tells

1716
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:42,789
you what to do

1717
01:13:40,329 --> 01:13:44,859
it says sit on me and so that and there

1718
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:46,420
are people who have prefrontal damage

1719
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:48,880
and they engage in something called

1720
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,619
utilization behavior and if they're

1721
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,119
walking down the hallway and there's a

1722
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:54,699
door opened they have to walk through it

1723
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:56,769
they can't not do what the object tells

1724
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:59,559
them to do that's called utilization

1725
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:03,640
behavior so that's how the world is laid

1726
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,800
out and I would say inside that domain

1727
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,660
you're in the predictable world you're

1728
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,579
in the world that you understand it that

1729
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:11,680
you know and that if you hit an obstacle

1730
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,090
or if you're outside that domain you're

1731
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:18,210
in the unknown you're in unknown

1732
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:20,770
territory in the mythological world in

1733
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:22,960
the world for action you could

1734
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:27,910
conceptualize the world as a stage for

1735
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:30,819
action and this is a Shakespearean quote

1736
01:14:27,909 --> 01:14:34,000
that sort of sums it up quite nicely all

1737
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:35,579
the world is a stage and all the men and

1738
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,539
women merely players

1739
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:39,309
they have their exits and their

1740
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:42,310
entrances and one man in his time plays

1741
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,530
many parts and you might say well is

1742
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:46,840
that really true and the answer to that

1743
01:14:44,529 --> 01:14:49,539
is well it depends on what you mean by

1744
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,159
true and and that really is the answer

1745
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:58,479
because there are different ways of

1746
01:14:51,159 --> 01:15:00,760
defining true so and it isn't

1747
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:03,459
self-evident that there's only one way

1748
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,079
of defining true that's appropriate

1749
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,289
you know the definition of truth might

1750
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:09,939
be more like a tool and you know we are

1751
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:11,469
tool using creatures and really what

1752
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:13,889
we're trying to do with our conceptions

1753
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:16,689
of truth is to work through the world

1754
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:19,810
successfully so even science is

1755
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:22,269
subordinate should be subordinate to our

1756
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:24,670
use of the world as a tool because if it

1757
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,989
isn't useful tool like what are we doing

1758
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:28,000
with it you know

1759
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:30,339
just generating technology that might

1760
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,850
destroy the world that seems like a bad

1761
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,890
idea

1762
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:37,780
so so I think that that the world as

1763
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:39,700
tool is actually the fundamental sword

1764
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:42,759
of truth and I think that that's a

1765
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:44,949
Darwinian idea right that that our

1766
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,690
notions about the world have evolved

1767
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:50,729
through a Darwinian process and that

1768
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:55,109
it's appropriate for us to regard as

1769
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:59,859
what is most real those things that

1770
01:15:55,109 --> 01:16:02,079
reliably ensure are the continuation of

1771
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:04,269
our life and the probability of our

1772
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,729
propagation and if you're a true

1773
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:09,790
Darwinian I don't think there's a way

1774
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:11,769
out of that argument and it isn't

1775
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:14,649
self-evident by any stretch of the

1776
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:18,070
imagination that seeing the world as all

1777
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:20,199
as objects is the way that our brain

1778
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:22,090
works in fact I don't think it's the way

1779
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:29,738
it works at all and I think that that's

1780
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:31,150
why we're so wired for stories right

1781
01:16:29,738 --> 01:16:33,519
it's a mystery

1782
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:37,449
you know like you won't line up for two

1783
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,010
hours to go see a lecture but you'll

1784
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:40,840
line up for two hours maybe you'll even

1785
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:43,270
camp overnight if you're mythological

1786
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,569
imagination has been seized for god only

1787
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:49,210
knows what reason by Star Wars and you

1788
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:51,488
know that's the source of mythology

1789
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:54,699
it's the mythology of the modern person

1790
01:16:51,488 --> 01:17:01,509
and it fills a gap and that's why people

1791
01:16:54,699 --> 01:17:03,159
do it so that to me speaks of men the

1792
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:05,770
manner in which our psyches are

1793
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:07,300
constructed and that's a union idea

1794
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:10,780
that's the idea of the archetype

1795
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:12,880
essentially that to be human is to

1796
01:17:10,779 --> 01:17:17,380
participate in a certain pattern of

1797
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:19,329
being and that that pattern of being is

1798
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,239
socially it's acted out individually but

1799
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:25,000
it's also part of your structure even

1800
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:28,209
your perceptual structure as a as a

1801
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,149
living organism of your particular type

1802
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:33,969
and it would be the case at least in

1803
01:17:31,149 --> 01:17:36,929
part that the hero myth which is go out

1804
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:40,329
where no one has gone before

1805
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:43,869
face they terrors of the unknown gather

1806
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:47,198
something of value and return is the

1807
01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:50,380
central story of humankind it's not the

1808
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:53,879
only central story but it's it's up

1809
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:56,469
there in the top three and many of the

1810
01:17:53,880 --> 01:18:01,179
dramas that you engage yourself in are

1811
01:17:56,469 --> 01:18:03,939
variations of that story and you watch

1812
01:18:01,179 --> 01:18:05,920
it over and over and over because you're

1813
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:14,769
trying to learn how to do that because

1814
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:20,350
that's what you need to do to live okay

1815
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:20,980
here's the here's an idea what's common

1816
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:25,989
among people

1817
01:18:20,979 --> 01:18:27,789
well we're self conscious so we know of

1818
01:18:25,988 --> 01:18:31,299
our own existence and we know of our own

1819
01:18:27,789 --> 01:18:33,819
limitations and so that means that we

1820
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:37,480
have a certain innate terror and

1821
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:39,969
fragility our existence is a problem to

1822
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:41,500
us and in some sense what we're trying

1823
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:42,969
to do when we search for meaning is to

1824
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:45,429
search for a solution to that problem

1825
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:47,560
and that can be security but it don't

1826
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:49,600
can also be mode of being you know and

1827
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,699
so for example being engaged in

1828
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,159
something worthwhile seems to be a good

1829
01:18:51,698 --> 01:18:55,750
medicine for being fragile you know

1830
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,158
because you think well I'm doing this it

1831
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:59,079
seems worthwhile and the fact that

1832
01:18:57,158 --> 01:19:00,939
there's a price to be paid for it and

1833
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:02,649
that things could befall me that aren't

1834
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:04,448
good I'm willing to put up with that

1835
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:06,219
because what I'm engaged in seems to be

1836
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:10,388
of appropriate of sufficient

1837
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:11,800
significance to justify all that we all

1838
01:19:10,389 --> 01:19:13,630
become self-conscious and we're all

1839
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:18,670
trying to do something about that figure

1840
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:21,060
out how to deal with it so there's a

1841
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:23,590
landscape that we inhabit I would say

1842
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:27,730
within which that takes place so there's

1843
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:30,850
a human being self conscious doomed to

1844
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,829
tragedy and doomed to be aware of that

1845
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:34,240
the human being has two elements and

1846
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:35,829
that's the element that seeks the good

1847
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:39,880
and there's the other element that seeks

1848
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:42,220
I would say revenge and destruction and

1849
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,079
we have our reasons you know if

1850
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,240
something tragic happens to you it's

1851
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,340
tragic and unfair and it really brings

1852
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,349
you low the probability that you're

1853
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,270
going to become resentful and want

1854
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:54,400
revenge is extraordinarily high at no

1855
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,710
wonder and you know the archetypal

1856
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:59,739
representation of that is evil itself

1857
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:01,899
and the archetypal representation of the

1858
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:05,529
good that you could do is is the hero

1859
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:07,359
and so those things inhabit us they're

1860
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:10,899
they're permanent elements of the human

1861
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:13,329
psyche and then what else is universal

1862
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:16,179
to us well we live in a society you

1863
01:20:13,329 --> 01:20:18,970
could say and that's deep that's deep

1864
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:21,190
it's not just human society like we've

1865
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:24,369
lived in a society forever so you know

1866
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:27,250
lobsters live in dominance hierarchies

1867
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:29,019
and they use their serotonin system at

1868
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,180
least in part to keep track of their

1869
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,890
dominance position and so you can use

1870
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,990
antidepressants on lobsters when they

1871
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:37,240
get defeated and they don't feel so bad

1872
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:38,889
from being defeated in a fight and so

1873
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:40,619
you just think about that because the

1874
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:45,400
antidepressants do the same thing to us

1875
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:49,109
we're so bloody social that the circuits

1876
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:52,929
that evolved 300 million years ago when

1877
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:55,420
the lobsters in us had a shared ancestor

1878
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:57,730
are still operating at the base of your

1879
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:00,039
brain that's why status is so important

1880
01:20:57,729 --> 01:21:02,469
to people and reputation I mean that

1881
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:04,689
serotonin system governs your emotional

1882
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:06,490
regulation how people respond to you and

1883
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:08,289
what they think of you man that matters

1884
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:10,649
that's why you're on Facebook all the

1885
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:13,000
time and checking your texts and and

1886
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:14,949
obsessing continually about your online

1887
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,140
presence and assuming that you're doing

1888
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:18,939
that and you know contacting people

1889
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:21,850
frantically and seeing what the updates

1890
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:24,429
are it's like where where how are you

1891
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:25,900
held in the esteem of others very very

1892
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:27,369
important and that's because it

1893
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:30,579
determines your emotional regulation

1894
01:21:27,369 --> 01:21:33,039
it's really important so we exist in a

1895
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:35,229
society always and the society has two

1896
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,029
elements the tyrannical element of the

1897
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:39,039
society that would be the tyrannical

1898
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:41,259
king roughly speaking a very common

1899
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:44,229
mythological theme you see that in the

1900
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:45,460
Lion King - right because that's scar

1901
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:49,209
and of course you see it in the real

1902
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:52,420
world with almost continually and then

1903
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:54,489
the benevolent king who is the source of

1904
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,930
all the good things about culture you

1905
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:58,738
know and and you can see these things

1906
01:21:55,930 --> 01:22:01,630
play out as mythologies in political

1907
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:04,629
terms so I would say for example the

1908
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:07,239
continual harping about the oppressive

1909
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:10,720
nature of the patriarchy is part of a

1910
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:12,819
myth and the myth is that society is

1911
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:16,060
oppressive it's like well yeah obviously

1912
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:17,590
you know because you have to be quite a

1913
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,960
bit like you and you have to be quite a

1914
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:21,699
bit like you even if you're not so that

1915
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,829
you can get along right everybody

1916
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:27,220
sacrifices a tremendous amount of their

1917
01:22:23,829 --> 01:22:30,519
individuality to the common to the

1918
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:32,980
common mode of being that's there's a

1919
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:35,860
tyrannical element to that but you know

1920
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:38,559
by the same token it's the basis of

1921
01:22:35,859 --> 01:22:42,130
cooperation and the stability of society

1922
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:44,050
and the the final element is that's

1923
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:46,060
often represented met in a masculine

1924
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:48,369
manner by the way society and I think

1925
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:50,200
that's because our primary dominance

1926
01:22:48,369 --> 01:22:53,710
structures given the creatures we are

1927
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:56,619
like chimpanzees the primary structures

1928
01:22:53,710 --> 01:23:01,380
of dominance are masculine and then

1929
01:22:56,619 --> 01:23:01,380
outside of what's known is the unknown

1930
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:08,589
and we always have to contend with that

1931
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:10,149
and it's wonderful in that it's the

1932
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:12,130
source of all new things and it's

1933
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:14,589
terrible in that it's the place where

1934
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:17,380
all the things that destabilize you come

1935
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:20,260
from and so this is a good

1936
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:25,359
representation although not the only one

1937
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:27,250
so that's the feminine nature that's the

1938
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:29,380
masculine order and that's the

1939
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:34,020
individual who's destined to suffer in

1940
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:34,020
the grasp of those two things and

1941
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:48,570
I'll finish this next time what have we

1942
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:52,649
got here yep

1943
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:54,799
all right good enough we'll see you next

1944
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:54,799
time

1945
01:23:54,979 --> 01:24:03,179
so today to begin with we're going to

1946
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:05,010
finish the last lecture and then with

1947
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,780
any luck we're gonna start the next one

1948
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:09,360
there somatically linked anyways well

1949
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:12,149
you know what all the lectures for the

1950
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,909
next well for the whole course hopefully

1951
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:17,250
will be thematically late to some degree

1952
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:19,260
given that nominally they're about the

1953
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,340
same topic but some are more tightly

1954
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:27,060
linked than others

1955
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:28,920
so I started telling you last week about

1956
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,670
this idea of the voyage to the

1957
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,779
underworld

1958
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:38,460
and I want to tell you a little bit more

1959
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:39,869
about that young in particular

1960
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:42,510
conceptualized the voyage to the

1961
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:46,349
underworld as a journey into the

1962
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:49,320
unconscious and the unconscious for the

1963
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:53,300
psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and

1964
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:55,829
dream an implicit presupposition and

1965
01:24:53,300 --> 01:25:00,000
habit and that's all correct you know we

1966
01:24:55,829 --> 01:25:01,738
there is an unconscious and it's

1967
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,119
perfectly reasonable to conceptualize it

1968
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:06,119
that way that the big difference I think

1969
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:10,380
between the psychoanalysts and the later

1970
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:13,159
more empirical scientists is that the

1971
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:19,409
psychoanalyst sort of envisioned your

1972
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:23,809
psyche as a place of living partial

1973
01:25:19,409 --> 01:25:27,659
personalities instead of cognitive

1974
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:29,730
computational systems you know they took

1975
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:33,210
into account the fact that you're alive

1976
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:34,439
and that the parts of you are alive and

1977
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:36,090
you know there's there's a

1978
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,139
neuroscientist named gives that Gazza

1979
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:43,380
Nick I don't know how to say his name

1980
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:46,079
Gazza nigga that's wrong is that

1981
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:48,359
Gazzaniga yeah I think that's it anyways

1982
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:51,029
he did some of the earliest experiments

1983
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:52,769
on split brains and so sometimes if you

1984
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:55,909
have intractable epilepsy which I

1985
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,910
wouldn't recommend by the way

1986
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:01,030
one of the surgical procedures for

1987
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:03,460
mediating its negative effects is

1988
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:05,710
something called a you cut the corpus

1989
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:08,789
callosum and it's very large number

1990
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:11,079
large structure in the brain that

1991
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:12,488
connects the two separate hemispheres

1992
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:14,199
and you know it's not obvious why we

1993
01:26:12,488 --> 01:26:15,729
have two separate hemispheres although

1994
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:17,590
I'll tell you a little bit about why I

1995
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:23,069
think it is but anyways they do

1996
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:26,529
communicate and what Gazzaniga

1997
01:26:23,069 --> 01:26:28,988
demonstrated was that you could tell one

1998
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:32,319
hemisphere something without the other

1999
01:26:28,988 --> 01:26:34,509
one knowing that both hemispheres were

2000
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:37,779
conscious and that the consciousness was

2001
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:39,100
somewhat independent it really strange

2002
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:41,590
it's very interest makes very

2003
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:44,860
interesting readings reading you know

2004
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:46,659
because it suggests that fragments of

2005
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:48,460
ourselves you could think of you have

2006
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:50,529
fragments of yourself within you that

2007
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:52,359
are like low resolution representations

2008
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:53,979
of you you know and that and the

2009
01:26:52,359 --> 01:26:55,659
psychoanalysts would think of those more

2010
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:57,579
as they're kind of like they're kind of

2011
01:26:55,659 --> 01:26:58,659
like one-eyed Giants that might be a way

2012
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,340
of thinking about it if you were

2013
01:26:58,659 --> 01:27:03,399
thinking about it in a fantastical way

2014
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:06,100
so there's the angry you and you know

2015
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:10,000
you've all come in contact with the

2016
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:11,590
angry you it's a rather rigid that's the

2017
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,988
first thing you might say about it it's

2018
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:16,719
impulsive and short-term it doesn't

2019
01:27:13,988 --> 01:27:19,029
think much about the past unless it's

2020
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:21,069
bad things about whoever you're angry at

2021
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:23,649
in which case it thinks about them a lot

2022
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:26,590
it's not too concerned with long-term

2023
01:27:23,649 --> 01:27:31,269
future consequences and mostly it wants

2024
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:35,289
to be right and you know when angry you

2025
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:38,380
disappears and normal you assuming such

2026
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:40,810
a thing exists reappears you can be

2027
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:45,670
perfectly shocked about how angry you

2028
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:47,710
behaved and in fact sometimes if angry

2029
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:51,819
you really gets out of hand like it

2030
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:53,590
might in a battle like a war it might do

2031
01:27:51,819 --> 01:27:55,539
things that you just can't imagine that

2032
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:58,900
you would do and under those

2033
01:27:55,539 --> 01:28:01,840
circumstances you can reveal parts of

2034
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:07,899
yourself to yourself that are so foreign

2035
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:09,969
and so horrifying that it will leave you

2036
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:14,679
with post-traumatic stress disorder

2037
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:16,630
because it is the case that many but not

2038
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,310
all people who suffer from

2039
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:21,210
post-traumatic stress disorder

2040
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:23,430
especially if it's battlefield related

2041
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:26,079
get it because of something they did

2042
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:27,969
rather than something they saw or

2043
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:30,069
something that happened to them and

2044
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:31,840
that's really we're thinking about you

2045
01:28:30,069 --> 01:28:34,329
know I mean there's a lot of weird

2046
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,800
potential nested inside people and you

2047
01:28:34,329 --> 01:28:37,630
know you don't see it under normal

2048
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,779
circumstances because the circumstances

2049
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:43,270
are normal and part of the reason that

2050
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:47,559
we like the circumstances to be normal

2051
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:50,280
is precisely so that we don't see those

2052
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:53,140
parts of people we don't want to see and

2053
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:56,409
that's really worth knowing it's really

2054
01:28:53,140 --> 01:29:00,010
worth knowing because that's why people

2055
01:28:56,409 --> 01:29:01,719
are so identified with their culture and

2056
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:03,789
why they need a culture you know the

2057
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:05,829
terror management theorist types they

2058
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:07,960
kind of think of culture as a mechanism

2059
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:09,850
that inhibits anxiety and they think

2060
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,469
about it psychologically like it's it's

2061
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:14,770
something inside your your head let's

2062
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:17,710
say and it gives meaning to events and

2063
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:22,420
stops you from collapsing into chaos and

2064
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:24,340
protects you from death anxiety but that

2065
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:26,920
isn't that's not right it's sort of

2066
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:29,909
right but that isn't what your culture

2067
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:33,969
is your culture is a set of value Laden

2068
01:29:29,909 --> 01:29:37,840
presuppositions that you orient yourself

2069
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:40,060
in the world that match the set of value

2070
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:43,210
Laden presuppositions that everyone in

2071
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:45,370
your culture has and acts out and so

2072
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:47,170
what that means is that when you believe

2073
01:29:45,369 --> 01:29:50,590
something and you're among your own

2074
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:52,000
people you believe something implicitly

2075
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:53,860
it's the way you look at the world it's

2076
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,630
the way you act things out you act about

2077
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:57,549
everyone expects you to act about

2078
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:59,829
they're happy about it in fact so

2079
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:01,510
there's a match between what you're

2080
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:03,698
doing what you see and what you're doing

2081
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:06,210
and what other people expect and it's

2082
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:08,919
that match that regulates your emotions

2083
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:11,560
it's not the belief system it's the

2084
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:14,739
match and so part of the reason that

2085
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:17,620
people are so tied to their cultural

2086
01:30:14,738 --> 01:30:22,238
identity is because their cultural

2087
01:30:17,619 --> 01:30:23,779
identity regulates their emotions and in

2088
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:25,879
a profound way like this is

2089
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:29,630
no joke you know I mean one of the

2090
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:31,880
things that stabilizes human nervous

2091
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:33,618
systems is imagine that you have a

2092
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,389
domain of competence there's many

2093
01:30:33,618 --> 01:30:36,889
domains of competence and of course in

2094
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:38,750
some of those domains you're completely

2095
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,730
incompetent but they met me not matter

2096
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:42,288
because you don't go into that domain so

2097
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:43,939
you have some area of specialization

2098
01:30:42,288 --> 01:30:46,609
which you might think of as your

2099
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:48,649
sub-tribe you know your university

2100
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:51,259
students and so some of you are lower

2101
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:53,448
status by the rules of the university

2102
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:55,550
game and some of you are higher status

2103
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:57,138
by the rules of the university game by

2104
01:30:55,550 --> 01:31:00,440
the tribe and so the higher status

2105
01:30:57,139 --> 01:31:02,210
people tend to be the ones who fit into

2106
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:05,538
the academic environment you know and

2107
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:08,510
and find it conducive to their mode of

2108
01:31:05,538 --> 01:31:11,809
being and all who also do well and their

2109
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:15,010
serotonin levels rise and you know the

2110
01:31:11,809 --> 01:31:18,500
neuro chemicals that moderate mood

2111
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:20,630
particularly are serotonergic its

2112
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:22,250
serotonin it's lots of other things it's

2113
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:24,618
an oversimplification but that'll do for

2114
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:26,618
now as you become dominant in a

2115
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:29,569
hierarchy your serotonin levels rise and

2116
01:31:26,618 --> 01:31:32,000
what that means is that happy things

2117
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:34,549
make you happier and sad things make you

2118
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,988
less sad it Tunes your nervous system so

2119
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:37,909
if you're down at the bottom of the

2120
01:31:35,988 --> 01:31:40,479
hierarchy and you're failing it's like

2121
01:31:37,908 --> 01:31:42,920
hey hardly anything makes you happy and

2122
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,928
everything makes you nervous and it's no

2123
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:50,809
wonder because it's it's not very good

2124
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:52,880
down there so the the societal structure

2125
01:31:50,809 --> 01:31:56,329
which which is an elaborated dominance

2126
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,099
hierarchy regulates your emotions

2127
01:31:56,328 --> 01:31:59,808
because of the match between your

2128
01:31:58,099 --> 01:32:01,849
expectations and the behaviors of the

2129
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:03,260
people within that structure and then

2130
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:06,559
your position within the hierarchy

2131
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:08,090
regulates the rate ratio let's say and

2132
01:32:06,559 --> 01:32:09,949
the intensity between positive and

2133
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:13,309
negative emotion so you mess with

2134
01:32:09,948 --> 01:32:16,219
people's status at your peril and you

2135
01:32:13,309 --> 01:32:20,300
disrupt their culture they don't like

2136
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:22,460
that and no wonder because when it's

2137
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:25,429
disrupted they fall into chaos and chaos

2138
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:28,130
isn't just anxiety the anxiety is bad

2139
01:32:25,429 --> 01:32:29,989
enough but it's not just anxiety because

2140
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:31,989
when you fall into chaos when things

2141
01:32:29,988 --> 01:32:35,058
fall apart for you

2142
01:32:31,988 --> 01:32:37,189
of course you're uncertain and anxious

2143
01:32:35,059 --> 01:32:37,619
because you don't know what the hell is

2144
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:39,149
going

2145
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:40,439
on and you don't know where you are and

2146
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:42,449
you don't know what to do Pat's

2147
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,159
anxiety-provoking and maybe you can't

2148
01:32:42,449 --> 01:32:45,809
even understand your past properly

2149
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:48,449
anymore that as I said that happens when

2150
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:52,500
people get betrayed and so you fall into

2151
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:54,119
this state where nothing is certain the

2152
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,250
way you construe the world isn't certain

2153
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:58,619
and even the way the world is is no

2154
01:32:56,250 --> 01:33:01,079
longer certain because you don't know

2155
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:03,119
how to act or your actions aren't

2156
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:05,100
working and so the world is presenting

2157
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,769
itself as something that's chaotic it's

2158
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:10,620
not just psychological the chaos is a

2159
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:13,170
weird intermingling of the chaotic world

2160
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:14,909
and the chaotic self I mean that's what

2161
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:17,730
happens when you get unemployed it's

2162
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:20,099
like it's devastating right it's

2163
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:21,539
devastating to people and it you could

2164
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,110
say well that's psychological it's like

2165
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:26,670
well yeah but they're unemployed that

2166
01:33:25,109 --> 01:33:29,189
makes the world far more

2167
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:30,480
incomprehensible and uncertain it's not

2168
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:32,969
just psychological

2169
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:35,250
it's psychological and that's bad but

2170
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:37,289
it's also real and that's even worse and

2171
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:40,859
then those two things can spiral which

2172
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:42,810
they often do because you know if you

2173
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:45,389
don't set your expectations properly for

2174
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:48,210
a job search and assume that you're

2175
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:50,220
gonna get 49 rejections for every

2176
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:53,039
interview which you really need to know

2177
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:54,750
because if you get 49 rejections it's

2178
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,810
not because you're useless it's because

2179
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:59,789
the baseline for rejection is 98% and

2180
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:03,360
that's okay because the base rate for

2181
01:33:59,789 --> 01:34:05,369
rejection for everything is 98% no

2182
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:06,869
matter what you do but you need to know

2183
01:34:05,369 --> 01:34:08,789
that so that you don't feel that it's

2184
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:10,529
like something wrong with you and of

2185
01:34:08,789 --> 01:34:13,590
course you only have to get it right

2186
01:34:10,529 --> 01:34:15,689
once that then you have a job it's a

2187
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:17,100
lottery but you have to set yourself up

2188
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:19,139
you have to think okay well I'm gonna

2189
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,870
look for a job I need to how many

2190
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:23,820
resumes can I tolerate sending out a day

2191
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:26,189
you know it has to be enough so you

2192
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:28,979
don't feel like a useless moron and it

2193
01:34:26,189 --> 01:34:32,339
can't be so many that you're overwhelmed

2194
01:34:28,979 --> 01:34:33,839
by the burden so and I help people do

2195
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,880
this sort of thing all the time so maybe

2196
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,039
you decide well you're gonna send out

2197
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,720
ten a day and you're gonna work two

2198
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:42,420
hours on it and it's gonna take six

2199
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:44,579
months and then you know you've got your

2200
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:46,230
parameters set properly and you would

2201
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:50,698
know what to expect in the world and and

2202
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:53,488
your emotions are regulated and so but

2203
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:55,969
the state of being unemployed doesn't

2204
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:59,788
just produce psychological consequences

2205
01:34:55,969 --> 01:35:01,349
so the distinction between the psyche in

2206
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:04,859
the world in some sense is quite

2207
01:35:01,349 --> 01:35:07,498
arbitrary and the psychoanalysts I think

2208
01:35:04,859 --> 01:35:09,630
it air too much on the side of the

2209
01:35:07,498 --> 01:35:11,938
subject they tend to think that too much

2210
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:14,880
of you is inside of you and too little

2211
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:17,369
of you is outside of you and part of the

2212
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,300
reason I believe that is because of my

2213
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:21,598
clinical experience

2214
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:24,708
I love the psychoanalyst man they're

2215
01:35:21,599 --> 01:35:27,630
brilliant they're brilliant they're deep

2216
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:29,880
they grapple with real problems like

2217
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:31,918
with the problems when people have real

2218
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,958
problems that I mean profound problems

2219
01:35:31,918 --> 01:35:35,309
there really won't profound moral

2220
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:37,288
problems or problems of good and evil

2221
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:39,239
really you know there are things going

2222
01:35:37,288 --> 01:35:42,809
on in their family that are so terrible

2223
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:43,859
that well that there are there are

2224
01:35:42,809 --> 01:35:46,800
sometimes fatal

2225
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:50,308
you know lie upon lie upon lie upon lie

2226
01:35:46,800 --> 01:36:01,880
for decades and decades and decades it's

2227
01:35:50,309 --> 01:36:01,880
awful and that's not exactly inside them

2228
01:36:01,998 --> 01:36:07,288
it's out there in the world and lots of

2229
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:11,938
the people that I see very famous critic

2230
01:36:07,288 --> 01:36:16,078
of psychology I can't remember his name

2231
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:18,659
but I probably will criticize the

2232
01:36:16,078 --> 01:36:21,630
practice of psychology quite effectively

2233
01:36:18,658 --> 01:36:25,429
in the leave in the early 60s the myth

2234
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:28,529
of mental illness by Thomas says Szasz

2235
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:30,328
it's a classic you should read it if

2236
01:36:28,529 --> 01:36:32,880
you're interested in psychology read it

2237
01:36:30,328 --> 01:36:35,429
like it's it's a classic and he

2238
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,840
basically said most people have problems

2239
01:36:35,429 --> 01:36:40,918
in living they don't have psychological

2240
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:44,069
problems and so I've experienced despite

2241
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:45,898
my love for the psychoanalysts very

2242
01:36:44,069 --> 01:36:49,049
frequently what I'm doing as a therapist

2243
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:52,709
is helping people have a life that would

2244
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:56,309
work you know and you can parameterize

2245
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:58,708
that it's like what do you need how

2246
01:36:56,309 --> 01:36:59,969
about some friends that people kind of

2247
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:01,559
like that how about an intimate

2248
01:36:59,969 --> 01:37:03,779
relationship with someone that you can

2249
01:37:01,559 --> 01:37:04,650
trust that maybe has a future that would

2250
01:37:03,779 --> 01:37:06,210
be good

2251
01:37:04,649 --> 01:37:08,849
how about a career that puts you in a

2252
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:10,529
dominance hierarchy somewhere so at

2253
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:12,510
least you've got some possibility of

2254
01:37:10,529 --> 01:37:15,179
rising some possibility of stabilizing

2255
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:17,670
yourself and our schedule in a routine

2256
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:19,770
because no one can live without a

2257
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:22,680
routine you just forget that if you guys

2258
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:25,050
don't have a routine I would recommend

2259
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:27,000
like you get one going because you

2260
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:29,279
cannot be mentally healthy without a

2261
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,739
routine you need to pick a time to get

2262
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:34,199
up whatever time you want but pick one

2263
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:36,630
and stick to it because otherwise you

2264
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:39,929
dis regulate your circadian rhythms and

2265
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:42,720
they regulate your mood and eat

2266
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:44,640
something in the morning I had lots of

2267
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:46,320
clients who've had anxiety disorders I

2268
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:49,800
had one client who was literally

2269
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:51,269
starving very smart girl sheet there's

2270
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,039
very little that she liked she kind of

2271
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:55,080
tried to subsist on like half a cup of

2272
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:57,569
rice a day she came to me and said I

2273
01:37:55,079 --> 01:37:59,430
have no energy I come home all I want to

2274
01:37:57,569 --> 01:38:02,579
do is watch the same movie over and over

2275
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:04,289
what like is that weird and I thought

2276
01:38:02,579 --> 01:38:06,569
well it depends on how hard you work you

2277
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:09,210
know it's a little weird but whatever

2278
01:38:06,569 --> 01:38:11,909
it's familiar you're looking for comfort

2279
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:14,939
so I did an analysis of her diet it's

2280
01:38:11,909 --> 01:38:18,239
like three quarters of a cup of rice

2281
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:22,199
it's like you're starving eat something

2282
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:26,130
you know you'll feel better

2283
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:27,929
so she modified her diet and her all her

2284
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:34,340
anxiety went away and she had some

2285
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:36,960
energy it's like yeah you got to eat so

2286
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:38,730
schedule that's a good thing man your

2287
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,069
brain will thank you for it it will

2288
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:43,409
stabilize your nervous system with it's

2289
01:38:41,069 --> 01:38:45,119
a bit of a plan that's a good thing you

2290
01:38:43,409 --> 01:38:47,789
need a career you need something

2291
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:49,680
productive to do with your time you need

2292
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:52,350
to regulate your use of drugs and

2293
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:55,789
alcohol most particularly alcohol

2294
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:55,789
because that does even a lot of people

2295
01:38:56,779 --> 01:39:01,529
you need a family like the family you

2296
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:03,329
have your parents and all that be nice

2297
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:04,859
if you all got along you could work on

2298
01:39:03,329 --> 01:39:06,479
that that's a good thing to work on and

2299
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:09,989
then you know you probably need children

2300
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:13,259
at some point that's life that's what

2301
01:39:09,989 --> 01:39:15,869
life is and if you're missing you know

2302
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:18,570
you may have a good reason to not be

2303
01:39:15,869 --> 01:39:21,750
operating on one of those dimensions

2304
01:39:18,569 --> 01:39:24,000
it's not mandatory but I can tell you

2305
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:26,159
that if you're not operating reasonably

2306
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,750
well on four I think I mentioned six if

2307
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:30,869
you're not operating reasonably well on

2308
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:34,069
at least three of them there's no way

2309
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:37,470
you're going to be psychologically

2310
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:39,210
thriving and that's more pragmatic in

2311
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:41,820
some sense than psychological right

2312
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:44,430
human beings have a nature there's

2313
01:39:41,819 --> 01:39:46,349
things we need and if we have them well

2314
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:48,600
that's good and if we don't have them

2315
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:51,120
well then we feel the lack and so

2316
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:53,220
behaviorists behavioral psychologists

2317
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:53,670
concentrate a lot more on that sort of

2318
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:56,210
thing

2319
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:59,190
you know it's practical it's like

2320
01:39:56,210 --> 01:40:00,390
strategizing make a career plan figure

2321
01:39:59,189 --> 01:40:02,009
out how to negotiate because that's

2322
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:04,170
bloody important figure out how to say

2323
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:07,760
what you need figure out how to tell the

2324
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:12,090
truth to people figure out how to listen

2325
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:13,289
to your partner in particular because if

2326
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:15,930
you listen to them they will actually

2327
01:40:13,289 --> 01:40:17,609
tell you what they want and sometimes

2328
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:19,380
you can give it to them and maybe

2329
01:40:17,609 --> 01:40:22,229
they'll return the favor and if you

2330
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:24,000
practice that for like 15 years well

2331
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:26,579
then maybe you're constantly giving each

2332
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,560
other what you want well hooray that

2333
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:32,340
would be good and then there's two of

2334
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:34,100
you under all circumstances and it's

2335
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:36,510
better to have two brains than one

2336
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:39,900
because people think differently because

2337
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:42,690
of their temperament mostly and so the

2338
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:45,389
negotiation is where the wisdom arises

2339
01:40:42,689 --> 01:40:46,829
and it's part of the transformation the

2340
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,900
psychological transformation that's

2341
01:40:46,829 --> 01:40:51,269
attendant on an intimate relationship

2342
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:55,229
and one of the fundamental purposes of a

2343
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:57,540
long-term intimate relationship anyways

2344
01:40:55,229 --> 01:41:00,619
when that falls apart chaos ensues and

2345
01:40:57,539 --> 01:41:04,019
that's why chaos is represented so

2346
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:05,279
continually in myths and stories and I'm

2347
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:08,790
going to walk you through a bit of that

2348
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:11,849
more today I talked about the story of

2349
01:41:08,789 --> 01:41:16,949
Jonah now here's something to think

2350
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:20,640
about the internal representations of

2351
01:41:16,949 --> 01:41:22,679
language meaning evolved partly from our

2352
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:25,140
pre linguistic ancestors knowledge of

2353
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:27,570
social relations like modern monkeys and

2354
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:29,970
apes our ancestors lived in groups with

2355
01:41:27,569 --> 01:41:32,340
intricate networks of relationships that

2356
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:34,170
were simultaneously competitive

2357
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,510
operative the demands of social life

2358
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:38,789
created selective pressures for just the

2359
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:40,710
kind of complex abstract conceptual and

2360
01:41:38,789 --> 01:41:42,769
computational abilities that are likely

2361
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:45,239
to have preceded the earliest forms of

2362
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:47,250
linguistic communication although

2363
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:49,769
baboons have concepts and acquire

2364
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:51,479
propositional information from other

2365
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:53,340
animals vocalizations they cannot

2366
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:55,229
articulate this information they

2367
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:56,970
understand dominance relationships and

2368
01:41:55,229 --> 01:41:59,339
matrilineal kinship but they have no

2369
01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:01,619
words for them this suggests that the

2370
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:04,920
internal representation of many concept

2371
01:42:01,619 --> 01:42:06,659
relations and actual action sequences

2372
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,250
does not require language and that

2373
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:10,079
language did not evolve because it was

2374
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:12,840
uniquely suited to representing thought

2375
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:15,420
well you you know you can think without

2376
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,690
language well take the case of someone

2377
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:21,510
who's deaf and mute they have no

2378
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:23,069
language well they can operate in

2379
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,520
society they learn how to represent

2380
01:42:23,069 --> 01:42:30,139
other people and they do that with image

2381
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:32,780
now with the post modernists who I

2382
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:36,420
despise would be a reasonable way of

2383
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:38,250
putting it have this proposition that

2384
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:40,050
there's no meaning outside language and

2385
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:43,579
and it's a powerful argument by the way

2386
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:43,579
but it's seriously wrong

2387
01:42:43,819 --> 01:42:48,029
there is a meaning network outside of

2388
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:52,130
language and it's what language is

2389
01:42:48,029 --> 01:42:54,179
grounded in and that's this pre verbal

2390
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:55,739
comprehension of the world it's an

2391
01:42:54,180 --> 01:43:00,180
embodied comprehension of the world

2392
01:42:55,739 --> 01:43:03,889
animals have it lobsters have it you

2393
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:06,960
know this particular scientist Seyfarth

2394
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:10,110
talks about our shared history with you

2395
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:11,909
know higher primates that probably goes

2396
01:43:10,109 --> 01:43:12,239
back 20 million years something like

2397
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:14,939
that

2398
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:18,929
we split from the common ancestor with

2399
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:22,469
chimps about 7 million years ago but you

2400
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:24,840
know lobsters have dominance hierarchies

2401
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:26,159
they hardly have a nervous system at all

2402
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,710
which is partly why they're studied

2403
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:31,170
quite extensively and so they have a

2404
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:34,680
social structure and they understand it

2405
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:37,190
like if one lobster thira lobster to be

2406
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:39,450
quite a shark to you if it happened and

2407
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:41,729
you were fighting with another lobster

2408
01:43:39,449 --> 01:43:43,199
and you lost you would remember that and

2409
01:43:41,729 --> 01:43:46,078
the next time you saw that lobster you'd

2410
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:47,969
scuttle off somewhere else and you

2411
01:43:46,078 --> 01:43:50,368
know that and all the lobsters in an

2412
01:43:47,969 --> 01:43:53,458
area know who's top lobster and who

2413
01:43:50,368 --> 01:43:57,598
isn't and top lobster gets the best

2414
01:43:53,458 --> 01:44:01,408
bloody place to be and the best food so

2415
01:43:57,599 --> 01:44:03,899
this dominance issue this cultural issue

2416
01:44:01,408 --> 01:44:06,748
you know the fact that we live in a

2417
01:44:03,899 --> 01:44:08,579
social environment is far deeper than

2418
01:44:06,748 --> 01:44:10,708
people usually consider and it's also

2419
01:44:08,578 --> 01:44:12,148
worth considering and that this is what

2420
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:13,288
you might think of from an evolutionary

2421
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:16,859
perspective you know you think of

2422
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:19,529
natural selection as producing evolution

2423
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:21,659
right well random mutation with natural

2424
01:44:19,529 --> 01:44:24,779
selection but here's something to think

2425
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:27,208
about and Darwin knew this but Darwin

2426
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:29,009
was really smart and the biologists who

2427
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:32,398
followed in his footsteps even up to now

2428
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:35,099
have only expanded out a fraction of

2429
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:38,939
what he had to say you know he was very

2430
01:44:35,099 --> 01:44:40,378
interested in sexual selection now one

2431
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:43,559
of the things about human beings that's

2432
01:44:40,378 --> 01:44:46,618
unique is that human females are picky

2433
01:44:43,559 --> 01:44:48,510
majors they're choosy

2434
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:50,219
they're also sneaky because you can't

2435
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:54,649
tell when they're ovulating and with

2436
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:57,300
many other female animals you know so

2437
01:44:54,649 --> 01:45:00,119
they have hidden ovulation and they're

2438
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:01,949
choosy and they tend to choose men who

2439
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:05,038
are more successful in the dominant

2440
01:45:01,948 --> 01:45:08,538
turkey well they're there's a shock I

2441
01:45:05,038 --> 01:45:10,858
mean if you have a choice why not

2442
01:45:08,538 --> 01:45:13,559
if you pick someone who's at the bottom

2443
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:14,760
of the competence hierarchy well that's

2444
01:45:13,559 --> 01:45:17,609
probably not going to work out very well

2445
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:29,010
for you and since women bear the burden

2446
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:30,479
of representation you know when you

2447
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,219
think of a doorman sorry you might think

2448
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,499
well it's the powerful guy the

2449
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:35,908
aggressive guy say that rises to the top

2450
01:45:34,498 --> 01:45:37,608
of the doorman it's hurricane that's not

2451
01:45:35,908 --> 01:45:41,219
true it's not even true among chimps

2452
01:45:37,609 --> 01:45:42,780
like you can get a chimp tyrunt but then

2453
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:44,489
what happens is other chimps gang up on

2454
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:45,509
him and tear him to pieces and they

2455
01:45:44,488 --> 01:45:48,208
don't do it nicely

2456
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:50,338
they don't do it nicely and the chimps

2457
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:52,108
that tend to maintain their dominance

2458
01:45:50,338 --> 01:45:54,300
for long periods of time have a pretty

2459
01:45:52,109 --> 01:45:56,760
wide network of friends roughly speaking

2460
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,769
with whom they engage in reciprocal

2461
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,880
interactions like grooming and they

2462
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,739
actually pay a lot of

2463
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:03,539
attention to the female chimps who have

2464
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:05,670
their own hierarchy by the way and to

2465
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:08,970
the their offspring so they're like baby

2466
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:11,100
kissing politicians and so the idea that

2467
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:15,000
it's raw power that produces dominance

2468
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:17,280
is a it's just wrong it's it's wrong now

2469
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,470
you know tyrants you know it's pretty

2470
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:21,029
damn up unstable business being a tyrant

2471
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:23,310
there's lots of people who want to kill

2472
01:46:21,029 --> 01:46:26,460
you plus you know you tend to rule over

2473
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:28,410
something approximating hell so maybe

2474
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:30,470
that's bit worse better than being a

2475
01:46:28,409 --> 01:46:35,550
subject in hell but it's not much better

2476
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:37,409
so anyway so this social social now so

2477
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:41,190
what this means think about this for a

2478
01:46:37,409 --> 01:46:42,420
minute so imagine you know imagine what

2479
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:44,460
I'm telling you bears some vague

2480
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,529
resemblance to the truth I think there's

2481
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:49,890
quite a lot of evidence for it from from

2482
01:46:46,529 --> 01:46:52,679
a biological perspective I mean this

2483
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:54,329
choosy mating thing occurs with lots of

2484
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:56,310
species you know there's this bird

2485
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:59,399
called the bower bird you got to look up

2486
01:46:56,310 --> 01:47:01,470
bowerbirds man those things are you just

2487
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:03,750
can't even believe they exist and so the

2488
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:05,340
male bowerbird he makes this really

2489
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:07,560
complicated nest that's close to the

2490
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:10,829
ground he weaves it it's really quite

2491
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:14,789
nice you couldn't make one so and then

2492
01:47:10,829 --> 01:47:17,489
he sweeps this yard in front of the nest

2493
01:47:14,789 --> 01:47:19,189
and then he runs around the forest or

2494
01:47:17,489 --> 01:47:22,559
flies cuz he is a bird

2495
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:24,479
finding pretty things so maybe he'll

2496
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,789
find a nice collection of red leaves and

2497
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,500
so then he'll take the red leaves one by

2498
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:30,210
one and fly back to his front yard and

2499
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:32,489
make a little square you know he's a

2500
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:34,409
bird so it's not a great square but he

2501
01:47:32,489 --> 01:47:35,519
makes a little patch of red and he takes

2502
01:47:34,409 --> 01:47:37,859
a look at that and then he goes off and

2503
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,270
finds something blue and and he

2504
01:47:37,859 --> 01:47:41,489
decorates it makes a little piece of

2505
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:44,220
abstract art in the front of his nest

2506
01:47:41,489 --> 01:47:46,619
and a lot of male bowerbirds do this all

2507
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:48,570
at the same time and so then the females

2508
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:51,269
come along they hop on something nearby

2509
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:54,000
and they kind of look like this checking

2510
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:55,620
it out and if they're happy with it well

2511
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,569
then things proceed but if they're not

2512
01:47:55,619 --> 01:48:01,649
they'd fly off to someone else's piece

2513
01:47:57,569 --> 01:48:03,779
of abstract art and if a male piece of

2514
01:48:01,649 --> 01:48:06,389
art is rejected by like three females in

2515
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:08,489
a row he gets irritated and brushes it

2516
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:12,000
all off with his wing and then he makes

2517
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:13,500
another one it's like God well they

2518
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,899
obviously have a sense of where

2519
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:18,689
well developed sense of beauty it's so

2520
01:48:15,899 --> 01:48:21,569
cool you know and I guess the idea is

2521
01:48:18,689 --> 01:48:24,750
that who knows what the hell the idea is

2522
01:48:21,569 --> 01:48:26,429
the female birds like artistic males

2523
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:28,260
something like that but if you're

2524
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:30,600
thinking about it biologically maybe

2525
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:32,640
it's an indication of intelligence right

2526
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:35,039
it's a marker of intelligence you know

2527
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:40,050
and it's certainly the case that female

2528
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:43,229
humans prefer creative men so and no

2529
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:44,640
wonder of course we wouldn't be creative

2530
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:46,679
if that wasn't the case so then imagine

2531
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:49,289
that there's two primary forces of

2532
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,270
evolutionary selection operating on us

2533
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:52,710
and they're not really the natural world

2534
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:55,380
which is what people always think like

2535
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:58,050
the environment you know the animals and

2536
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:00,449
the trees and nature but it is nature

2537
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:03,329
that selected us it's two other things

2538
01:49:00,449 --> 01:49:04,979
well partly it's two other things so one

2539
01:49:03,329 --> 01:49:06,779
is the dominance hierarchy the male

2540
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:10,439
dominance hierarchy is one of the

2541
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:12,899
primary mechanisms of selection so it's

2542
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:14,669
like well women are faced with a hard

2543
01:49:12,899 --> 01:49:17,609
choice which guy to go after right

2544
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:19,560
that's a hard choice well so they do the

2545
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:21,769
same thing that people do with the stock

2546
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:24,600
market they outsource the cognitive

2547
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:26,520
problem the computational problem to the

2548
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,560
male dominance hierarchy then they just

2549
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:30,150
let the male Sirk themselves out however

2550
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,460
they're going to and then they appeal

2551
01:49:30,149 --> 01:49:34,259
from the top and so what that means is

2552
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:36,779
the dominant male dominance hierarchy

2553
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:39,480
itself is a selection mechanism because

2554
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:43,649
if you fail at it then you don't leave

2555
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:46,919
any offspring and so what that means at

2556
01:49:43,649 --> 01:49:49,949
least in part is that we have adapted to

2557
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,560
be better and better at attaining status

2558
01:49:49,949 --> 01:49:54,569
in dominance hierarchies over god only

2559
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:57,390
knows how long a period of time and that

2560
01:49:54,569 --> 01:49:59,279
doesn't mean just power you know it

2561
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:01,710
might mean cognitive flexibility because

2562
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:04,559
you could imagine dormant its hierarchy

2563
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:06,510
a dominance hierarchy be dormant its

2564
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,250
hierarchy see okay so if like if you're

2565
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:11,400
really successful you climb up dominance

2566
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:13,529
hierarchy a right but you'd be and see

2567
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:16,609
know if you happen to land it knows you

2568
01:50:13,529 --> 01:50:19,199
just be a failure so then you could say

2569
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:20,819
the ideal human being is someone who can

2570
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,989
climb to the top of a doorman it's her

2571
01:50:20,819 --> 01:50:28,279
key no matter what the doorman is

2572
01:50:21,989 --> 01:50:32,279
hierarchy is right so we've evolved to

2573
01:50:28,279 --> 01:50:34,619
we've evolved such that success across

2574
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:37,710
the set of possible dominance

2575
01:50:34,619 --> 01:50:39,300
hierarchies is the target and I think

2576
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:41,069
that's why we have general intelligence

2577
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,909
because general intelligence is a

2578
01:50:41,069 --> 01:50:46,619
general problem-solving mechanism and

2579
01:50:43,909 --> 01:50:48,899
it's a single factor even like there is

2580
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:52,079
intelligence is a single factor it's

2581
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:58,309
it's not divisible despite what people

2582
01:50:52,079 --> 01:51:03,359
like Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner

2583
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:07,320
falsely claimed so and then from the

2584
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:09,569
female perspective females are the next

2585
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:11,219
gatekeeper and that's why they're often

2586
01:51:09,569 --> 01:51:12,869
Mother Nature took me a long time to

2587
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:15,869
figure this out why the hell is nature

2588
01:51:12,869 --> 01:51:18,239
feminine in mythological representations

2589
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:20,460
it's a very very it's extraordinarily

2590
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,500
common mother nature you don't think a

2591
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,989
father nature you think of mother nature

2592
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:31,229
it's like why well nature brings forth

2593
01:51:24,989 --> 01:51:34,019
new forms so that's feminine and nature

2594
01:51:31,229 --> 01:51:35,899
select in fact that's the definition of

2595
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:39,930
nature from a Darwinian perspective

2596
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:43,859
nature is that which selects women

2597
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:46,619
select their nature and that's partly

2598
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:50,149
why far more men than you might think

2599
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:54,029
like far more are terrified of women

2600
01:51:50,149 --> 01:51:59,460
because to be rejected as a romantic

2601
01:51:54,029 --> 01:52:06,059
partner by a woman is to be classified

2602
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:10,109
as vaguely acceptable life form huh no

2603
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:13,140
value in propagating it though right so

2604
01:52:10,109 --> 01:52:16,799
it's a major major rejection and you

2605
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:19,340
know I've had dozens of clients and many

2606
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,510
many people write to me whose primary

2607
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:23,730
problem is that they're so terrified of

2608
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:28,770
women they can't even approach them very

2609
01:52:23,729 --> 01:52:31,379
very very common so all right I want to

2610
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:33,980
show you this little triangle thing this

2611
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:33,980
is kind of cool

2612
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:48,369
go yet so no no nonverbal right

2613
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:49,539
nonverbal so what happened well there's

2614
01:53:48,369 --> 01:53:52,829
mother triangle

2615
01:53:49,539 --> 01:54:00,369
I would guess and mutter triangle has

2616
01:53:52,829 --> 01:54:02,500
circle as a child and triangle is maybe

2617
01:54:00,369 --> 01:54:10,300
a friend but not one that's very welcome

2618
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:12,689
according to mother and child Circle

2619
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:16,420
goes out to try to play with triangle

2620
01:54:12,689 --> 01:54:17,679
child and mother doesn't like that so

2621
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:18,970
she goes out there and pecks the hell

2622
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:23,650
out of her out of him

2623
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:27,280
chases him away pushes child circle back

2624
01:54:23,649 --> 01:54:29,500
into the home and goes into the home and

2625
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:30,039
then child circle isn't very happy about

2626
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:32,109
that

2627
01:54:30,039 --> 01:54:35,859
it's running around causing trouble and

2628
01:54:32,109 --> 01:54:37,689
it manages to escape and then bad child

2629
01:54:35,859 --> 01:54:39,219
triangle shows up and they play together

2630
01:54:37,689 --> 01:54:40,689
and run around and run around and round

2631
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:43,150
around and run around with mother

2632
01:54:40,689 --> 01:54:45,879
chasing them and then they well maybe

2633
01:54:43,149 --> 01:54:48,009
they elope who knows and then mother

2634
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:52,810
triangle has a fit and blows down the

2635
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:54,520
house right it's obvious reasonable

2636
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:59,200
would you consider that a reasonable

2637
01:54:54,520 --> 01:55:01,060
story about what happened perhaps you

2638
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:04,510
had other interpretations but I suspect

2639
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:06,010
they were vaguely along that line well

2640
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:07,989
but the point here in this is the point

2641
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:09,850
of this experiment is how much

2642
01:55:07,988 --> 01:55:11,919
information do you need from which to

2643
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:15,160
derive a narrative and the answer is

2644
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:17,560
like none it just it's just immediate

2645
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:20,159
you you can watch some triangles moving

2646
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:24,670
around a box and instantly you

2647
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:27,069
personalize it and that's because that's

2648
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:30,010
what you're like and the reason you're

2649
01:55:27,069 --> 01:55:34,149
like that is because your environment

2650
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:36,610
isn't nature your environment is culture

2651
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:40,139
your environment is other people other

2652
01:55:36,609 --> 01:55:42,399
people and that was even more true for

2653
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:45,100
chimpanzees and so forth and especially

2654
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,899
animals that had a limited diet like

2655
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:50,020
like gorillas they pretty much only eat

2656
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:53,349
like leaves you know a chimp spends like

2657
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:54,790
12 hours a day chewing and

2658
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:57,579
that's where they have a gut like this

2659
01:55:54,789 --> 01:55:58,659
it's like you can't eat leaves you know

2660
01:55:57,579 --> 01:56:00,369
have you tried

2661
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:01,539
they have no nutrition so if you're

2662
01:56:00,369 --> 01:56:04,840
gonna eat leaves you have to eat a lot

2663
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:08,109
of them and then it takes like three

2664
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:09,520
months to digest them and so what we've

2665
01:56:08,109 --> 01:56:12,039
done and this is pretty cool because

2666
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,800
we're so smart is that we've traded gut

2667
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:17,739
for brain and that's why we're so svelte

2668
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:19,630
and the way we manage that it appears is

2669
01:56:17,739 --> 01:56:22,840
that we learned how to use fire to cook

2670
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:24,400
things and that meant that we had high

2671
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:26,020
quality nutrition much higher it's

2672
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:29,079
easier to digest cooked things

2673
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:31,150
especially meat and so because we

2674
01:56:29,079 --> 01:56:33,460
invented fire we didn't have to have so

2675
01:56:31,149 --> 01:56:36,729
much intestine and we could spend a

2676
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:38,890
little more time on the brain so human

2677
01:56:36,729 --> 01:56:40,899
beings really are fire users we invented

2678
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:43,420
fire or discovered it or whatever man

2679
01:56:40,899 --> 01:56:47,139
mastered it at least a couple of million

2680
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:51,779
years ago a long time so that's all

2681
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:56,800
pretty cool as far as I'm concerned so

2682
01:56:51,779 --> 01:56:58,630
that's partly how you think and that's

2683
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:00,820
naturally how you think you think a

2684
01:56:58,630 --> 01:57:02,409
certain way and so we'll say that your

2685
01:57:00,819 --> 01:57:04,630
fundamental architecture is social

2686
01:57:02,409 --> 01:57:07,750
cognitive you tend to view the world as

2687
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:09,730
if it's personified and the reason for

2688
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:12,039
that is that the world in which you

2689
01:57:09,729 --> 01:57:14,079
emerged as a being was primarily social

2690
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:15,970
and what you needed to know was who's

2691
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:17,619
the big primate who's the little primate

2692
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:19,960
and who's related to who and you know

2693
01:57:17,619 --> 01:57:23,170
among chimps if a big chimp is

2694
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:24,489
threatened by a small chimp well you

2695
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:27,130
know the big chimp could just tear the

2696
01:57:24,489 --> 01:57:30,159
small chimp apart but the big chimp will

2697
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:33,159
back off if it knows that the little

2698
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:36,069
chimp is associated with some really big

2699
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:38,199
chimps and so the little chimp can bully

2700
01:57:36,069 --> 01:57:40,750
the big chimp because it's part of a

2701
01:57:38,199 --> 01:57:42,909
dominant family and that's because the

2702
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:45,069
nervous system of the big chimp doesn't

2703
01:57:42,909 --> 01:57:46,899
respond to the little chimp like a

2704
01:57:45,069 --> 01:57:49,809
little chimp it responds to the little

2705
01:57:46,899 --> 01:57:52,299
chimp like it's a little chimp with four

2706
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:55,030
great monsters attached to it because

2707
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:57,640
it's true so it's nervous system is

2708
01:57:55,029 --> 01:58:00,639
actually responding to the network

2709
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:01,869
around the chimp and so that's exactly

2710
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:03,250
what you well it's not exactly what

2711
01:58:01,869 --> 01:58:06,699
you're like cuz you're not chimps but

2712
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:07,239
you know it's that kind of platform that

2713
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:09,579
constant

2714
01:58:07,239 --> 01:58:14,170
it's the evolutionary underpinnings of

2715
01:58:09,579 --> 01:58:16,720
your psyche so what does that mean well

2716
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:19,270
it means this is like perfectly fine to

2717
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:22,119
us right can animate things we can hit

2718
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:24,000
rabbits are people no problem will go

2719
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:26,769
along with that

2720
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,079
you remember Roger Rabbit I presume most

2721
01:58:26,770 --> 01:58:31,420
of you've watched that so this is the

2722
01:58:29,079 --> 01:58:33,489
detective whose name I don't remember he

2723
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:35,500
has to go to toontown because there's

2724
01:58:33,489 --> 01:58:38,019
cartoons and there's people and you know

2725
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:39,189
they share the same world and you can go

2726
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:41,260
to toontown although it's kind of

2727
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:43,269
annoying because cartoon figures are

2728
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:45,250
kind of annoying like there's slapstick

2729
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:48,030
types and so he's not very happy to be

2730
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:51,340
there and this is what it looks like

2731
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:55,000
right everything is animated meaning

2732
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:58,180
alive anima means soul by the way so

2733
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,340
everything has a personality and you

2734
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:02,350
know when you're reading books to kids

2735
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:04,630
the son has a personality train has a

2736
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:05,950
personality jet has a personality

2737
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:08,050
doesn't matter what it is it has a

2738
01:59:05,949 --> 01:59:09,519
personality and that's because the child

2739
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:11,739
is learning to understand the world

2740
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:13,750
using the architecture of social

2741
01:59:11,739 --> 01:59:14,979
cognitive architecture and so and the

2742
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:17,439
thing that's really interesting about

2743
01:59:14,979 --> 01:59:19,149
that this just blows me away you know

2744
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:21,219
evolution is conservative and so once

2745
01:59:19,149 --> 01:59:21,789
it's produced something it has to build

2746
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:25,390
on it

2747
01:59:21,789 --> 01:59:28,510
it's like dass the operating system it's

2748
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:30,820
like really it's still there if I

2749
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:32,470
remember correctly under Windows 10 you

2750
01:59:30,819 --> 01:59:35,109
can't get rid of the damn thing because

2751
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:38,079
it's part it's part of the structure now

2752
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:40,269
and it's like the keyboards we use which

2753
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:42,670
were actually designed to slow typers

2754
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:44,530
down because with mechanical typewriters

2755
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:46,960
if you type too fast the keys would jam

2756
01:59:44,529 --> 01:59:49,359
so they divine devise the keyboard to

2757
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:52,600
slow you down and we still use it which

2758
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:55,479
is stupid you know you want the high

2759
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,640
frequency letters close to your middle

2760
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:59,379
fingers that isn't what it's like at all

2761
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:02,470
but we can't change it because everyone

2762
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:05,020
uses it so your body plan that thing is

2763
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:08,550
been around a long time man if you look

2764
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:11,140
at mammals particularly but even lizards

2765
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:12,850
there's so much like us in their in

2766
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:14,410
their skeletal structure that it's just

2767
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:18,840
mind-boggling you know and we're all

2768
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:20,559
variants of this same symmetrical

2769
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:25,600
four-legged

2770
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:27,400
mouth here structure and so you have to

2771
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:29,800
build in what you have and if you have a

2772
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:31,359
social cognitive architecture then you

2773
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:33,250
have to first understand the world

2774
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:35,409
through the social cognitive categories

2775
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:37,720
and what's so bloody strange about that

2776
02:00:35,409 --> 02:00:39,670
is it actually seems to work we actually

2777
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:42,640
seem to develop a coherent

2778
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:45,550
representation of being I would say of

2779
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:47,800
being that's not the same as nature it's

2780
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:49,060
not the same as the world because when

2781
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:51,220
we think of the world we think of the

2782
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:52,840
objective world and I'm not talking

2783
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:54,640
about the objective world I'm talking

2784
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:56,730
about the world of human experience and

2785
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:58,930
we see that through social cognitive

2786
02:00:56,729 --> 02:01:01,599
filter and it makes perfect sense to us

2787
02:00:58,930 --> 02:01:04,329
and it works that's so strange

2788
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:06,700
so anyways everything's got this

2789
02:01:04,329 --> 02:01:07,390
animated nature and we don't have a

2790
02:01:06,699 --> 02:01:10,349
problem with that

2791
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:14,200
in fact we actually find it quite fun

2792
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:18,310
you know people go visit the Disney

2793
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:20,439
toontown and participate in it and and

2794
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:23,550
have fun with it and so that shows you

2795
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:25,839
as well how how natural it is for us to

2796
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:30,010
to view things this way you know cars

2797
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:32,470
have faces right designers know that

2798
02:01:30,010 --> 02:01:34,480
they know that people don't want a car

2799
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:37,119
with three headlights because like who

2800
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:39,909
wants to be associated with a three eyed

2801
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:41,800
monster no one it's like two eyes that's

2802
02:01:39,909 --> 02:01:46,389
something you could be comfortable with

2803
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:48,579
and so cars have faces like a BMWs the

2804
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:51,430
new ones they really look cat-like you

2805
02:01:48,579 --> 02:01:53,769
know and they have sexy curves they do

2806
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:58,360
they do there's been a more eye studies

2807
02:01:53,770 --> 02:02:00,190
of that so if you show men photographs

2808
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:01,269
of attractive women looking directly at

2809
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:02,710
them there's a little part of their

2810
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:04,660
brain called a nucleus accumbens that

2811
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:06,520
lights up because to have someone look

2812
02:02:04,659 --> 02:02:09,099
directly at you especially if they have

2813
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:11,590
like a smile is is interpreted as an

2814
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:13,480
invitation to approach and women they

2815
02:02:11,590 --> 02:02:15,699
have the same damn problem because with

2816
02:02:13,479 --> 02:02:17,079
women because if you go into drugstores

2817
02:02:15,699 --> 02:02:19,809
say and you look at women's magazines

2818
02:02:17,079 --> 02:02:22,119
they're all the same they've all evolved

2819
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:24,010
to the same endpoint they all have an

2820
02:02:22,119 --> 02:02:26,079
attractive woman on them all of them and

2821
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:27,640
they're looking right out and so when

2822
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:30,309
women see that they actually see it as

2823
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:33,280
something to it approach it's an ideal

2824
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:34,600
and you know when people say that those

2825
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:37,059
Beauty ideals are

2826
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,100
to women and all ideals are oppressive

2827
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:41,830
but the empirical research some of it

2828
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:46,329
done here suggests that interacting with

2829
02:02:41,829 --> 02:02:48,279
those images helps that it performs the

2830
02:02:46,329 --> 02:02:50,170
psychological function of helping the

2831
02:02:48,279 --> 02:02:52,269
woman equate herself with the ideal and

2832
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:54,460
in most cases that actually produces a

2833
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:56,080
pop and elevation and mood and you know

2834
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:57,789
think about it you're really gonna go to

2835
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,229
the magazines store when you're just

2836
02:02:57,789 --> 02:03:00,869
looking for something to do and you're

2837
02:02:59,229 --> 02:03:03,669
gonna buy something that makes you feel

2838
02:03:00,869 --> 02:03:05,289
depressed and oppressed it's like no

2839
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:07,119
you're not going to do that magazines

2840
02:03:05,289 --> 02:03:09,909
that do that to you they will die

2841
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:11,619
because no one will buy them and there's

2842
02:03:09,909 --> 02:03:13,779
a reason they all turned out the same

2843
02:03:11,619 --> 02:03:22,569
way it's like they're just responding to

2844
02:03:13,779 --> 02:03:26,739
demand so faces oh yes with regards to

2845
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:28,809
the sexy curves so a woman who looks a

2846
02:03:26,739 --> 02:03:30,609
woman's picture looking right at a man

2847
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:32,740
will produce this activation in the

2848
02:03:30,609 --> 02:03:34,989
primary reward system cocaine produces

2849
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:38,559
the same response and so does sports

2850
02:03:34,989 --> 02:03:40,510
cars especially curvy red sports cars

2851
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:42,310
and so that's why you often see an

2852
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:45,280
attractive woman sitting on a curvy red

2853
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:48,100
sports car in an ad because it's you

2854
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:50,050
know if there's a an ad for beer on the

2855
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:52,539
side it's like hey everything's perfect

2856
02:03:50,050 --> 02:03:55,060
so and you know those are all primary

2857
02:03:52,539 --> 02:03:57,819
real reward representations and they

2858
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:59,140
produce attraction because part of

2859
02:03:57,819 --> 02:04:01,569
positive emotion that dopamine

2860
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:03,910
dopaminergic Li mediated element of

2861
02:04:01,569 --> 02:04:06,399
positive emotion is an approach emotion

2862
02:04:03,909 --> 02:04:08,289
it's not a satiation satisfaction

2863
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:10,269
emotion it's oh good there's something

2864
02:04:08,289 --> 02:04:12,789
good here I can move towards it and that

2865
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:15,820
that is what happiness is that's

2866
02:04:12,789 --> 02:04:17,380
directly what happiness is it's not

2867
02:04:15,819 --> 02:04:19,779
attaining something because that just

2868
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:21,930
puts in a whole new problem you got to

2869
02:04:19,779 --> 02:04:29,229
figure out what to do next

2870
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:31,539
alright so I suggested to you that one

2871
02:04:29,229 --> 02:04:35,169
of the problems that we have the problem

2872
02:04:31,539 --> 02:04:37,060
I would say is not what the world is

2873
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:39,250
made out of but how we should be in the

2874
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:41,260
world because we're alive and how we

2875
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:44,979
should be well it's fairly

2876
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:46,750
straightforward not so much pain would

2877
02:04:44,979 --> 02:04:48,399
be good that'd be good not too much

2878
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:51,488
anxiety hey we're

2879
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:55,929
bored for that little pleasure down then

2880
02:04:51,488 --> 02:04:59,229
some stability not dying that's a big

2881
02:04:55,929 --> 02:05:00,539
one that's a big one and then let's say

2882
02:04:59,229 --> 02:05:03,698
from the Darwinian perspective

2883
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:05,079
propagating and so that's what rained

2884
02:05:03,698 --> 02:05:06,669
out and the reason we're aimed at that

2885
02:05:05,079 --> 02:05:11,140
is you just think about this it's so

2886
02:05:06,670 --> 02:05:13,960
amazing so every single one of your of

2887
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:17,890
the relatives you have in your ancestry

2888
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:21,658
every single one of them successfully

2889
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:23,920
produced a child who successively

2890
02:05:21,658 --> 02:05:27,448
successfully produced a child all the

2891
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:30,069
way back to three billion years ago

2892
02:05:27,448 --> 02:05:31,869
it's bloody unbelievable like the

2893
02:05:30,069 --> 02:05:33,219
probability that you exist well it's a

2894
02:05:31,869 --> 02:05:36,069
hundred percent because there you are

2895
02:05:33,219 --> 02:05:38,020
but the probability of predicting that

2896
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:40,630
you would exist you know if you tried to

2897
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:42,550
predict it it's like you the chance that

2898
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:45,640
the chances that you're here are so

2899
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:48,239
infinitesimal that it's just absolutely

2900
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:51,789
mind-boggling think about that unbroken

2901
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:55,029
sequence of success over literally over

2902
02:05:51,789 --> 02:05:58,929
billions of years god it's amazing and

2903
02:05:55,029 --> 02:06:01,319
so you have to obviously you have to

2904
02:05:58,929 --> 02:06:03,550
think that there's a pretty strong

2905
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:06,609
proclivity for that to happen I mean

2906
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:09,510
some of obviously was necessity but not

2907
02:06:06,609 --> 02:06:12,969
only that I mean it's necessary that

2908
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:14,770
impregnated females have an infant it

2909
02:06:12,969 --> 02:06:19,119
isn't necessary that they keep it alive

2910
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:21,900
so you can't account for that continuity

2911
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:25,179
merely from necessity you have to

2912
02:06:21,899 --> 02:06:27,698
interject least a small amount of

2913
02:06:25,179 --> 02:06:29,500
consideration that the care that's

2914
02:06:27,698 --> 02:06:31,809
associated especially with taking care

2915
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:35,020
of infants because there you know there

2916
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:37,000
are a lot of work that's there to tennis

2917
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:39,100
it's actually I think it's manifested in

2918
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,289
the personality trade agreeable to us as

2919
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:42,370
it looks to be like agreeableness is one

2920
02:06:41,289 --> 02:06:45,698
of the dimensions where men and women

2921
02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:47,319
very most substantially agreeableness

2922
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:49,089
looks to be like the manifestation of

2923
02:06:47,319 --> 02:06:50,710
the maternal instinct now men can be

2924
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:52,900
agreeable to because of course male

2925
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:54,550
human beings take care of children you

2926
02:06:52,899 --> 02:06:56,859
know if you're a grizzly bear

2927
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:58,630
female you just chased the damn male

2928
02:06:56,859 --> 02:07:01,210
away because he'll kill your Cubs that's

2929
02:06:58,630 --> 02:07:02,170
not so helpful but they're not maternal

2930
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:04,480
at all

2931
02:07:02,170 --> 02:07:06,609
quite the contrary but you know human

2932
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:09,009
men are pretty damn maternal they're not

2933
02:07:06,609 --> 02:07:12,369
as maternal as women on average although

2934
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:14,380
some women are less maternal than some

2935
02:07:12,369 --> 02:07:19,179
men because you know the curves overlap

2936
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:20,739
but but on balance how are we in the

2937
02:07:19,179 --> 02:07:24,210
world well we're aware of our own

2938
02:07:20,738 --> 02:07:26,589
vulnerability who are aware of our own

2939
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:28,239
shortcomings let's say and that's I

2940
02:07:26,590 --> 02:07:29,679
think that's partly from being a social

2941
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:31,988
being because people are always

2942
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,609
signaling your shortcomings to you to

2943
02:07:31,988 --> 02:07:35,619
such a degree that you even signal your

2944
02:07:33,609 --> 02:07:36,849
shortcomings to yourself because well

2945
02:07:35,619 --> 02:07:38,319
you might as well fix them before

2946
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:41,320
someone else points them out that's

2947
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:42,909
guilt and shame you know when Freud

2948
02:07:41,319 --> 02:07:44,380
called out the super ego the super-ego

2949
02:07:42,909 --> 02:07:46,389
is kind of like the internalized

2950
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:49,300
representation of the judgmental father

2951
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:52,329
and culture I think is represented as a

2952
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:54,310
father figure God the Father let's say

2953
02:07:52,329 --> 02:07:55,988
because it's actually oh it's actually

2954
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:58,150
quite a bit like there is an all-seeing

2955
02:07:55,988 --> 02:07:59,738
eye that's always watching you it's a

2956
02:07:58,149 --> 02:08:03,299
really really intelligent way of

2957
02:07:59,738 --> 02:08:05,529
conceptualizing it because the group

2958
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:08,260
which is more or less eternal is

2959
02:08:05,529 --> 02:08:12,159
watching you all the time all the time

2960
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:14,140
and it's judging you all the time and we

2961
02:08:12,159 --> 02:08:16,029
know that if you put people in a room

2962
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:17,050
and you put a big eye on the wall you

2963
02:08:16,029 --> 02:08:19,750
know that you give them an opportunity

2964
02:08:17,050 --> 02:08:22,300
to cheat on some little Chiti thing you

2965
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:23,560
know nothing too important if they're in

2966
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:24,940
the room with the big eye they're less

2967
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:28,210
likely to cheat if they're in the room

2968
02:08:24,939 --> 02:08:29,710
with no eye at all so you know and what

2969
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:31,239
do you do you keep an eye on your kids

2970
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:32,980
and the reason you do that is so they

2971
02:08:31,238 --> 02:08:35,500
don't misbehave and we keep an eye on

2972
02:08:32,979 --> 02:08:37,869
each other and so we have a

2973
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:39,510
representation of that and as far as I

2974
02:08:37,869 --> 02:08:42,579
can tell we represent it as a

2975
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:46,570
transcendent figure of judgment and it's

2976
02:08:42,579 --> 02:08:56,100
like yeah it's hey that's a pretty good

2977
02:08:46,569 --> 02:08:56,099
metaphor so one of the

2978
02:08:57,939 --> 02:09:04,448
this is a major intellectual battle the

2979
02:09:01,229 --> 02:09:07,029
major intellectual battle and it's

2980
02:09:04,448 --> 02:09:11,519
raging in universities it's basically a

2981
02:09:07,029 --> 02:09:11,519
battle between post-modernism and

2982
02:09:11,579 --> 02:09:17,229
traditional and tradition I think that's

2983
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:19,060
the right way of thinking about it for

2984
02:09:17,229 --> 02:09:19,799
the post modernists human beings have no

2985
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:23,260
nature

2986
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:24,969
we're blank slates everything that we

2987
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:26,739
are is enculturated so we're completely

2988
02:09:24,969 --> 02:09:29,319
malleable and all elements of our

2989
02:09:26,738 --> 02:09:31,659
identity are valuable on the other side

2990
02:09:29,319 --> 02:09:35,439
are the traditionalists who are I would

2991
02:09:31,659 --> 02:09:39,960
say grounded more in biology on the one

2992
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:42,219
hand but also in in historical

2993
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:45,609
humanities tradition that suggests that

2994
02:09:42,219 --> 02:09:47,170
people have a nature I explained some of

2995
02:09:45,609 --> 02:09:49,569
that nature most people want to have

2996
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:51,609
threads it's part of your nature you

2997
02:09:49,569 --> 02:09:54,460
know most people want to find love

2998
02:09:51,609 --> 02:09:56,439
part of your nature and you suffer

2999
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:59,770
without it so and you know you could say

3000
02:09:56,439 --> 02:10:02,679
those are all social constructs but you

3001
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:07,150
can say you can say anything so you know

3002
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:09,369
and don't ever trust someone who has one

3003
02:10:07,149 --> 02:10:11,979
explanation for everything

3004
02:10:09,369 --> 02:10:12,550
you know how much intelligence does that

3005
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:15,099
take

3006
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:18,520
you got one explanation you just trot it

3007
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:20,289
out for every phenomena this is an

3008
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:23,199
alternative now here's what happened in

3009
02:10:20,289 --> 02:10:26,560
part Nietzsche

3010
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:28,799
back in the late 1800s was very

3011
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:31,750
interested in the dissolution of

3012
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,640
traditional faith in the West we fell

3013
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:35,770
out of our myth that's a way of thinking

3014
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:37,600
about it we start believing in its

3015
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:39,699
fundamental axioms we start believing

3016
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:42,610
that there was such a thing as a

3017
02:10:39,698 --> 02:10:44,319
transcendent deity for example it did it

3018
02:10:42,609 --> 02:10:47,349
didn't mesh well with the emerging

3019
02:10:44,319 --> 02:10:49,210
scientific viewpoint and so in the late

3020
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:55,420
1800s Nietzsche announced the death of

3021
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:56,649
God which sounds fairly presumptuous but

3022
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,960
it wasn't something he was celebrating

3023
02:10:56,649 --> 02:11:01,089
the full quote and I haven't got it

3024
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,520
exactly right is God's dead we've killed

3025
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:06,100
him and we'll never find enough water to

3026
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:08,050
wash away the rivers of blood so like

3027
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:10,289
that's a lot different than what you see

3028
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:13,980
scrawled on bathroom wall

3029
02:11:10,289 --> 02:11:15,750
you know and echip hypothesized that in

3030
02:11:13,979 --> 02:11:18,629
the 20th century millions of people

3031
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:21,029
would die in the conflicts over what

3032
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:22,710
values were going to reign as an

3033
02:11:21,029 --> 02:11:27,659
alternative to that tradition and he

3034
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:29,279
particularly brilliantly pointed to

3035
02:11:27,659 --> 02:11:31,109
communism he said that's where it's

3036
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:36,719
gonna be and Dostoyevsky did the same

3037
02:11:31,109 --> 02:11:38,609
thing and so and since then there's this

3038
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:40,110
being this battle hey and the battle is

3039
02:11:38,609 --> 02:11:42,769
kind of like this the battle is on the

3040
02:11:40,109 --> 02:11:45,539
one hand between social construction

3041
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:47,190
social constructionist utopians who

3042
02:11:45,539 --> 02:11:49,109
believe that human nature is infinitely

3043
02:11:47,189 --> 02:11:51,059
malleable and that with the proper

3044
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:52,829
transformations in society you can bring

3045
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:57,620
apart about the perfect state and the

3046
02:11:52,829 --> 02:12:02,279
perfect human being and and

3047
02:11:57,619 --> 02:12:04,529
traditionalists and young I think is the

3048
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:07,529
classic example of this who believe that

3049
02:12:04,529 --> 02:12:10,349
there is a human nature and it's deeply

3050
02:12:07,529 --> 02:12:13,170
embedded within us and that the cultures

3051
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:15,450
we set up have to manifest themselves in

3052
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:19,739
accordance with that nature or they will

3053
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:21,329
fail well Jung believed in the existence

3054
02:12:19,739 --> 02:12:23,909
of a meta-narrative

3055
02:12:21,329 --> 02:12:25,409
the hero myth roughly speaking and he

3056
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:28,739
explained its connections to various

3057
02:12:25,409 --> 02:12:30,869
religious traditions in a staggeringly

3058
02:12:28,739 --> 02:12:32,579
brilliant manner Camille Paglia

3059
02:12:30,869 --> 02:12:34,949
who I would recommend and I think I

3060
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:37,229
already told you that you know she she's

3061
02:12:34,949 --> 02:12:39,539
already concluded after going through a

3062
02:12:37,229 --> 02:12:42,449
radical feminist period early in her

3063
02:12:39,539 --> 02:12:44,250
life that the proper way for society

3064
02:12:42,449 --> 02:12:46,349
orient itself is within a mythological

3065
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:50,220
structure and that that's part of what

3066
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:55,350
the humanities provides and the

3067
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:58,289
alternative is rational arguments over

3068
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:59,970
what values are going to dominate and it

3069
02:12:58,289 --> 02:13:02,130
isn't obvious that rationality can solve

3070
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:04,770
that problem I don't think it can

3071
02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:07,710
that's Humes point David Hume said you

3072
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:09,630
can't derive an art from it is right you

3073
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:15,380
cannot use science as a guide to

3074
02:13:09,630 --> 02:13:18,920
behavior so what do you use instinct

3075
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:22,440
instinct manifested in imagination and

3076
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:24,149
the evolution the evolved structure of

3077
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:25,589
your organic cultures

3078
02:13:24,149 --> 02:13:28,199
something like that do they have a

3079
02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:30,539
structure that's the question okay so

3080
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:32,159
you ask yourself this question what is

3081
02:13:30,539 --> 02:13:35,430
it that every human being shares

3082
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:37,590
regardless of place and time so any

3083
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:40,650
universally comprehensive language that

3084
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:43,110
would be a meta-narrative a myth a hero

3085
02:13:40,649 --> 02:13:45,179
myth let's say a myth about what a human

3086
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:48,119
being not only is like but should be

3087
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:49,920
like has to speak to us about those

3088
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:51,269
aspects of experience that we all share

3089
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:53,430
because otherwise we wouldn't understand

3090
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:55,800
the damn story now we go to how we go to

3091
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:58,079
stories that we understand all the time

3092
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:59,760
like Star Wars and it really doesn't

3093
02:13:58,079 --> 02:14:02,880
matter what country you know everybody

3094
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:04,350
gets it more or less so obviously

3095
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,720
there's stories that we can understand

3096
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:08,190
and mutually you know we understand love

3097
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:09,600
stories we understand stories of

3098
02:14:08,189 --> 02:14:11,339
conflict we understand stories of

3099
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:13,230
betrayal we understand stories of anger

3100
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:15,510
and that's because we can feel jealousy

3101
02:14:13,229 --> 02:14:18,269
we can feel love we can feel anger it's

3102
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:20,400
it's part of you it's right there we

3103
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:22,380
even know where the circuits are you

3104
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:24,659
know and then you're like other animals

3105
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:31,980
they feel it too so very similar

3106
02:14:24,659 --> 02:14:35,369
emotions as far as we can tell so here's

3107
02:14:31,979 --> 02:14:39,239
here's this is derived in large part

3108
02:14:35,369 --> 02:14:44,880
from you but not only here's what we

3109
02:14:39,239 --> 02:14:47,130
share natural world social world and the

3110
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:49,529
fact of our existence as an individual

3111
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:52,170
and that can be represented different

3112
02:14:49,529 --> 02:14:55,369
ways it can be represented as you the

3113
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:58,380
known the and unknown or it could be you

3114
02:14:55,369 --> 02:15:01,079
culture and nature all the same

3115
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:04,710
representations and the cultural

3116
02:15:01,079 --> 02:15:08,630
representation tends to be male that's

3117
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:10,109
God the Father let's say and the

3118
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:15,989
representation the feminine

3119
02:15:10,109 --> 02:15:20,279
representation tends to be female this

3120
02:15:15,989 --> 02:15:22,159
is the known the culture Apple Indian

3121
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:24,210
control that's associated with the Sun

3122
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:26,670
consciousness the king the patriarchy

3123
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:29,730
the plow because it pushes up the earth

3124
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:31,109
the phallus obviously order and

3125
02:15:29,729 --> 02:15:32,609
authority and the crushing weight of

3126
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:37,049
tradition the wise old man and the

3127
02:15:32,609 --> 02:15:38,099
tyrant Dogma the day sky the country man

3128
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:40,199
the island heights

3129
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:46,680
the ancestral spirits the activity of

3130
02:15:40,199 --> 02:15:47,909
the dead Captain Hook he's a tyrant and

3131
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:49,680
that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to

3132
02:15:47,909 --> 02:15:51,840
grow up to become him and that's why

3133
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:53,850
Peter Pan does well because he thinks

3134
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,860
that adults are all tyrants why is

3135
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:58,230
Captain Hook a tyrant because a

3136
02:15:55,859 --> 02:16:00,059
crocodile ate his hand and the crocodile

3137
02:15:58,229 --> 02:16:01,349
has a clock in its stomach and the

3138
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:04,070
reason for that is that the crocodile is

3139
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:06,510
time and times already got a piece of

3140
02:16:04,069 --> 02:16:08,670
Captain Hook and he's not very happy

3141
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:10,770
about it he's bitter and resentful and

3142
02:16:08,670 --> 02:16:12,930
tyrannical and when Peter Pan looks out

3143
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:14,520
adulthood that's what he sees and he

3144
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:16,380
thinks why should I sacrifice the

3145
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:19,050
potential of childhood for the

3146
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:21,690
singularity of tyranny and so he stays

3147
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:25,409
immature his entire life and he's king

3148
02:16:21,689 --> 02:16:29,369
of the Lost Boys Jesus great there's a

3149
02:16:25,409 --> 02:16:30,809
porn star named Jeremy Christ I can't

3150
02:16:29,369 --> 02:16:34,619
remember his name it's really an ugly

3151
02:16:30,810 --> 02:16:37,649
guy he is he is he is an ugly guy he

3152
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:40,079
admits it and he said something funny I

3153
02:16:37,649 --> 02:16:43,590
was watching a documentary about him and

3154
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:46,799
he said the funniest thing he said I'm

3155
02:16:43,590 --> 02:16:50,340
the hero to people who think people like

3156
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:51,899
me are heroes I had what a drag a I mean

3157
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:54,299
he's just did in this horrible situation

3158
02:16:51,899 --> 02:16:56,459
he doesn't admire the people that admire

3159
02:16:54,299 --> 02:16:58,379
him but he gets admired by them all the

3160
02:16:56,459 --> 02:16:59,699
time well it's sort of like Peter Pan

3161
02:16:58,379 --> 02:17:03,239
it's like well he's king of the Lost

3162
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:06,270
Boys he doesn't get Wendy either right

3163
02:17:03,239 --> 02:17:08,218
she grows up she has a family he asked

3164
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:11,389
to content himself with Tinkerbell and

3165
02:17:08,218 --> 02:17:13,409
you know what Tinkerbell doesn't exist

3166
02:17:11,388 --> 02:17:15,569
well that's what happens when you don't

3167
02:17:13,409 --> 02:17:22,379
grow up that's a representation of

3168
02:17:15,569 --> 02:17:24,888
culture that's a nasty one eh he'll will

3169
02:17:22,379 --> 02:17:28,019
kiss us we'll kiss a statue of Stalin

3170
02:17:24,888 --> 02:17:32,489
who cares that he murdered 30 million

3171
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:33,719
people culture well you know in the

3172
02:17:32,489 --> 02:17:35,399
university you hear a lot about the

3173
02:17:33,718 --> 02:17:36,269
patriarchy and how impressive it is it's

3174
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:38,879
like yeah Yeah right

3175
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:41,159
definitely no kidding but you know it's

3176
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:44,309
kind of useful as well since it provides

3177
02:17:41,159 --> 02:17:46,649
light the food and all of that which you

3178
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:49,829
know kind of counterbalances it to some

3179
02:17:46,649 --> 02:17:51,239
degree culture has a pause development

3180
02:17:49,829 --> 02:17:52,079
and a negative element the individual

3181
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:54,119
has a positive

3182
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:55,679
the negative element nature has a

3183
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:58,229
positive element and a negative element

3184
02:17:55,679 --> 02:18:00,269
and if people tell you a one-sided story

3185
02:17:58,228 --> 02:18:02,849
which is the ideological story they

3186
02:18:00,269 --> 02:18:05,250
leave out that they say all culture is

3187
02:18:02,849 --> 02:18:08,058
terrible the human being is a Despoiler

3188
02:18:05,250 --> 02:18:12,000
and nature is perfect it's like no

3189
02:18:08,058 --> 02:18:14,759
nature kills you culture keeps you alive

3190
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,439
and there's things about you that are

3191
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:18,689
honorable and good as well as things

3192
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:20,609
about you that aren't and you need to

3193
02:18:18,689 --> 02:18:25,729
know both of those and that's what the

3194
02:18:20,609 --> 02:18:25,729
great stories tell us all right

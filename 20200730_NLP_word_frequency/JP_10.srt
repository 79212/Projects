1
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,339
I don't know if any other personality course

2
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,239
in North America talks about Binswanger and Boss anymore maybe not

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,314
But I think their ideas are extremely interesting

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,399
And so I'm going to talk about them

5
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,579
They were influenced very much by Martin Heidegger

6
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,699
Who was one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,200
I would say probably - This school of

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,179
This part of the phenomenological school

9
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,459
was more influenced directly by a philosopher than any other school.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,920
And just to reiterate because you might keep wondering why

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,280
I discuss so many philosophers in this course

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,840
It's because

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,759
Clinical Psychology in particular is not strictly a scientific enterprise

14
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,840
It's because it's oriented towards values as far as I can tell

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,719
And I don't see that there is any way of getting around that

16
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,939
and that because what you are trying to do as a clinical psychologist

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,180
and perhaps what you're trying to do with your own life  is to figure out how to live properly

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,380
Now you can construe that as the absence of illness

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,480
Which is - That's about as close as you get to a scientific model of living well

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,040
So you don't have any illnesses

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,380
But even the idea of illness is an idea that's not precisely scientific

22
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:34,599
It's an amalgam of scientific concepts and ethical concepts

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,780
so

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,719
There is no escaping it and if you're in the domain of ethics or values

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,439
Then you're in what is more or less a philosophical domain

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,995
But also if you're a scientist - if you're a scientist who is interested in personality

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,640
It's also something you have to grapple with conceptually

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,719
Because people live within an ethic and the ethic structures their perceptions

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,480
And so even to study human beings as objects

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,040
You still have to take into account they ensconce themselves within a value system

31
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,839
and you have to understand what that means

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,900
So for me it's easier and more straightforward just to get right to the root of matter to begin with

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,580
and these people also had insanely interesting ideas

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,399
They're really useful to know

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,000
And so this, I would say maybe these

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,215
The philosophy that underpins this might be the most complex of all the philosophies

37
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,159
That we're going to discuss

38
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,019
And that's really saying something because there is no shortage of complexities say in Jung

39
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,299
And it's very difficult to portray what these people were up to

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,680
I started by telling you, when we discussed Rogers a little bit

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:47,780
That the phenomenologists were interested in the fact that people live within a self-defined perceptual world

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,040
That might be one way of thinking about it

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,080
Part of the way to start to conceptualize what that means is to consider for a moment

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,840
just consider for a moment how many things there are in this room that you might look at

45
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,400
and the answer to that is there's an infinite number of them

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,700
Depending on how you're going to scale your perceptions

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,615
You could spend, if you were a painter, you could spend a month painting that tile

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,500
Painting a representation of that tile because it's infinitely complex

49
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,799
To get the colors right, to get the patterns right, there's no end to it really

50
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,500
Because to make a representation that was accurate

51
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,020
It would have to be as detailed as the thing itself and it's crazily detailed

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,760
But you don't concentrate on that sort of thing

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,580
So you think, you're surrounded by an infinite number of potential things to apprehend

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,235
But that isn't the world you live in

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,580
The world you live in is a very very constrained subset of those things

56
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,639
And part of the question is then: what's the nature of that constrained subset

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,879
That's what you inhabit that's what makes up your experience

58
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,599
And also how is it related to the infinitely complex objects that are around you

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,360
And that's really what these people were trying to figure out.

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,040
So you're in this perceptual frame, that's one way of thinking about it.

61
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,019
That's the Dasein, by the way

62
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,140
That's the existential frame or the phenomenological frame

63
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,339
Because you can't think about it merely as perception

64
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,659
Because it contains also, all of the things you experience subjectively

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,139
The emotions and the Qualia that

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,680
You know Qualia is an element of being

67
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,180
that say philosophers or scientists of consciouness have a particularly difficult time with.

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,879
And it's like - it's the quality of pain which doesn't seem reducible to a set of  objective facts

69
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,000
Or the quality of color, or the quality of beauty, or the quality of love, or the quality of sorrow

70
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,399
Those things seem irreducible to some degree in and of themselves

71
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,420
Like what is pain made of? It doesn't even seem like a reasonable question.

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:51,140
I mean you can say, how do you decompose the neurological circuits that are involved in the experience of pain? Fine.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,199
But to ask what pain consists of or is composed of or what beauty is composed of, or love.

74
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
Seems to be -  There is something wrong with the formulation of that question

75
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,079
Because those things sort of manifest them self as raw facts of existence

76
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,660
And so they're constituent elements of this - of your field of experience

77
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,500
Your phenomenological frame or this Dasein

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,120
Which is the way that Heidegger conceptualized it.

79
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:25,699
That's being there with you at the center of your what? Your realm of experience

80
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,939


81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,560
Now here's some characteristics of the Dasein

82
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,620
The thing that makes up you

83
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,514
The past and the present are implicit in it

84
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,420
What does that mean?

85
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,879
Well, say you have a particular emotional response to something, maybe it's a negative emotional response.

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,860
And you see this very frequently with arguments with people

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,500
You're having an argument with someone you love. Like a family member, that's a good example

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,540
So lets say it's the same damn fight you've had with your mother 50 times

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,180
Okay that's interesting because what it means is that

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,480
All of those 50 times you've fought with your mother are implicit in this fight

91
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,000
So althought it's taking place right here and now, the past has shaped it

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,000
And if you wanted to investigate the fight completely

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,139
You'd have to get to the bottom of that entire train of interactions you've had with your mother

94
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,780
So it's implicit in your current experience that's one way of thinking about it

95
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,939
But the future is implicit in it too because

96
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:34,259
What you're doing right now, it's as if the future is folded up in what you're experiencing right now and it unfolds as you interact with it

97
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,100
And so the reason it's conditional to some degree on you and your past is because

98
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:47,739
it's your past and you that are determining the actions that you undertake right now that determine how the future is going to unfold around you

99
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,719
Now not completely obviously because you don't have complete control over how things unfold

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,199
But you seem to have some ability to determine how things unfold

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,079
So one of the ways I've sort of conceptualized the phenomenological viewpoint

102
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,900
This is one way of thinking about it I believe is that

103
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:12,560
Instead of thinking - It does mean you have to reconceptualize your idea of objects

104
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,219
Like an object seems like a unidimensional thing in some sense. It's an object.

105
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,675
But most of the things people interact with aren't like that at all

106
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,574
So like here's an example

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's say you have

108
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,159
Let's say you get

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,480
You're writing the MCAT, you want to go to medical school

110
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,800
You've written the MCAT, you get the envelope in the mail, it tells you what your score is

111
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,759
You hold the envelope, what are you holding?

112
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,920
Well if you think about it from an objective perspective, it's an envelope

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,460
Who cares? It's just a little piece of paper right?

114
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,920
It's a rectangle of paper

115
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,020
But that isn't what you're holding at all

116
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:53,259
That's not what that thing is, that's how you see it. But it's not what it is at all and you know that. Your body knows that

117
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,879
Because you're shaking. Well, what are you scared of? The envelope?

118
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:04,780
Well the fact that you see it as an envelope is only an indication of just how narrow your perceptions actually are.

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,160
Because it's a portal.

120
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,460
Right? it's a portal through which you are going to walk into one of two worlds

121
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,899
One in which you're in medical school and the other in which you're not

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,760
And it also actually contains the past

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,939
Which is really strange because you think, well you already know what the past is. No you don't.

124
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:28,180
Whatever that score is in there determines what your past was and you know that too.

125
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,519
You go watch a movie and a bunch of things happen in the movie and then something twisted happens at the end  and all the sudden (trilling)

126
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,419
Everything that you thought about the movie was wrong

127
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,460
and a whole new past for the movie pops into being

128
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:47,420
Well, are you a pre-med student? A valid pre-med student? Well the score will determine whether or not you were.

129
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,299
Very strange, very strange

130
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,899
Because you think of the past as fixed

131
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,839
You know? And you think of the things you're interacting with as the things that you see and they're not

132
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,039
And you're body is smarter than that, way smarter than that. Because it responds to, you could say

133
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:09,399
And this is sort of a Rogerian perspective, your body is more likely to respond to what the thing actually is, than how it is that you see it.

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,879
Okay so, the past is implicit in the current being

135
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,559
and the future is implicit in the current being

136
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,080
And so the past and the future sort of folded up inside it

137
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,819
And you can unfold them and take a look at them

138
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,360
Now, here's the next thing

139
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,139
So, from a classic scientific perspective,

140
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,259
There's the world of independently existing objects and there's the world of subjects

141
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,080
And the subject is really in a secondary relationship to the object

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Because the objective world is what's real

143
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,860
But one of the things that the phenomenologists were concerned about that

144
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:57,399
Is that, well you run into this problem again of exactly how it is that you define the object

145
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:06,299
Because, just as the envelope with the scores in it can't be reduced to the paper,

146
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,279
So the object that you're interacting with only reveals what it is as a consequence of the way that you interact with it

147
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,600
So for example if you take a complex object like another person

148
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:24,759
It's like well, what is it that you are. Well a huge part of that is going to depend on exactly how I interact with you

149
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,679
Because you could be a raging beast if I interacted with you one way

150
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,460
and you could be a perfectly, you know, cooperative entity that was very pleasant if I interacted with you another way

151
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:43,540
And so partly what's happening - you can think of what you're interacting with as something that's really multi-faceted. Truly multi-faceted

152
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,899
And you say, well you're trying to determine what it is.

153
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,740
But the problem is that what it is manifests itself only in accordance with how you behave towards it

154
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,179
And it's actually the case with even objects that you reduce right down to their constituent elements

155
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:04,559
So you might say like lets talk about subatomic particles. Hypothetically, the most objective thing there is

156
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,939
Well it turns out that whether they're a wave or a particle depends on the way you set up the experiment

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Now I don't want to make quantum analogies but what I'm saying is that the object is a very very complicated thing

158
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,840
And so even defining what it is means you have to adopt a frame of reference with regards to it

159
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,939
And you undertake only some procedures and not others

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,379
So, when you're defining an object even scientifically you actually don't define the object.

161
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,960
What you say is here is a multi-dimensional entity if you approach it in this manner, that's the procedure, right? The methods.

162
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,220
If you approach it in that manner, it will manifest that set of traits

163
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,639
But the problem is, is that there's all sorts of other traits that it could manifest just as well

164
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,700
If you treated it a different way

165
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:55,479
And so the object itself is not something that - it's not something easily reducible to a single set of properties

166
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,979
I was talking to one of my students yesterday, he had a pretty smart thing to say about images.

167
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,600
We were talking about deep images you know the sorts that you might see in a really high quality museum

168
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:12,439
So maybe they're I don't know 15th century or 16th century renaissance  masterpieces

169
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,840
They're inexhaustible to some degree

170
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,459
Which is why they're in museums and people go look at them you know decade after decade

171
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
And it's partly because

172
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,699
Every time you look at them you're different

173
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,679
You go in one week, you look at it, you see something. You go in the next week, you look at it and you see something else.

174
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,419
Well it's partly because

175
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
You're bringing something entirely different to the situation

176
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:43,000
and the image is complicated enough to allow it to reflect something new to you depening on the stance you take in relationship to it

177
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,740
And lots of things are like that

178
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,039
lots of things are like that

179
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,940
A book you read when you were sixteen is going to be an entirely different book when you read it when you're 35

180
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,340
Say well the book's the same. It's like, it depends on how you define the book

181
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,799
Because it isn't even obvious where the book is exactly

182
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,539
Well it's on my shelf in the library

183
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,759
It's like no, that's a chunk of paper that's on your shelf in the library

184
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,799
Where exactly the book is, that's a much more difficult question to consider

185
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,339
So it depends on how you define the book

186
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,059
So without a subject, nothing at all would exist to confront objects and to imagine them as such

187
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,120
True this implies that every object

188
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,019
Everything objective in being merely objectified by the subject is the most subjective thing possible

189
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,939
Well you also know this again when you're in an argument with someone

190
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,720
"it's you"

191
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,740
"no, it's you"

192
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,679
"no it's you"

193
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,540
It's like, you don't know

194
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,399
Are you being biased? Are you looking at the situation incorrectly?

195
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,959
The person you're arguing with trying to convince you that it's your problem

196
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,200
You think "no you made me angry"

197
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,560
It's like hmm an interesting statement you know? as if you could do that

198
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,139
But it does seem that way, you were being provocative

199
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,259
"Well you're just too sensitive"

200
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,379
"hmm how are we going to settle that?"

201
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:09,939
Well it's a continual argument and that again has to do with the crazy entangled dynamic between subjective perception and objective perception

202
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,795
I've showed you this before and I actually think this is a pretty good

203
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:20,144
Schematic representation of what's meant by Dasein

204
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:22,559
And this is a complicated little diagram

205
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,840
Although the diagram itself is quite simple

206
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,759
It's predicated on the following assumptions

207
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,519
You need to narrow down your world

208
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,360
and what you're doing is narrowing it down from lets say an infinite set of possibilities

209
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,820
To a finite set of manageable possibilities

210
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,560
and you do that a bunch of ways

211
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,680
Partly - merely - you can't your senses aren't acute enough to detect everything.

212
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,079
So pure stupidity in some sense stops you from being absolutely overwhelmed

213
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,400
You don't have eyes in the back of your head for example so you don't have to worry about all those things you're not looking at behind you

214
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,639
But then it's far more than that

215
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,240
You just can't handle that full complexity so there's a continual narrowing process

216
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,780
And then you exist inside that narrowed reality

217
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,540
Like if I look at you like that

218
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:13,779
There's not a hell of a lot of difference between that looking at you like that

219
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,539
Like I can't really see these people. I can tell they're people, that's all

220
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,000
I can see your face

221
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,120
I've got just about all of it right there

222
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,479
That's a very narrow and you know you're moving your eyes around

223
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,634
and inhabiting this constant narrow space

224
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,720
Well what's that space - what does that space you inhabit consist of

225
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Well that's Dasein that space that you inhabit and so we can say

226
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,340
It's something like this

227
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,560
You have implicit in that perception a sense of where you are and what you are doing right now

228
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,759
it's in the perception

229
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,659
and then in the perception as well is what you're aiming at

230
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,779
Because you're not just sitting here passively or you'd be asleep or you'd be unconscious

231
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,260
You're sitting here doing nothing

232
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,319
You know, physically

233
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:00,100
But you have an aim in mind and the aim is what you're pointing your eyes at

234
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,639
The aim is what's structuring your perceptions

235
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:09,740
The aim is what's revealing that part of the world that is being revealed to you, to you

236
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
That's the revelation of the world

237
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,539
It also structures your emotions. It also primes your behaviors

238
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,440
So it's not a drive, it's not a goal

239
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,759
it's not a motivation, it's more than that. It's all of that at once.

240
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,585
That's sort of what your personality is

241
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,579
You see the phenomenologists don't really think about personality

242
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,034
They think about the manifestation of your reality

243
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,039
It's not exactly your personality

244
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,840
It's that you're the center of a reality and you constitute that reality

245
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,600
But all of your elements of experience constitute that reality and so it's simplest element is something like

246
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,300
Where you are and where you're going and the embodied actions you undertake to relate those two things

247
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:56,979
Which would include your eye movements because of course perception is an active phenomena

248
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,099
You are shaking your eyes back and forth unbelievable rapidly

249
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,740
Otherwise, if you can make your eyes stand still, which you can do with great concentration

250
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,519
Everything will black out

251
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:14,319
Because you have to move your eyes back and forth so the light hits different cells cause the cells get exhausted

252
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,000
And then they stop reporting. So you're just whipping your eyes back and forth in a micro-way constantly

253
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,580
And as well as moving them around voluntarily and involuntarily

254
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,220
So even perception is a lot more like feeling things out with your fingers

255
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,419
Even when you're using your ears or your eyes

256
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,164
It's very active, there's no passive perception

257
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,240
it's a motor act to perceive

258
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,899
and so your motor act is determined by your hierarchy of values that's one way of looking at it

259
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,095
So another way of thinking about it is that's how the past and future are implicit in it

260
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:50,179
Your very active perception is determined by your entire value structure

261
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,700
So

262
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:54,365
It's implicit inside of it, it's folded up inside of it

263
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,279
You can tell that too because if something violates it

264
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,839
Again, maybe an argument with someone

265
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,259
It's good to think about people as the thing you interact with the most as the canonical object

266
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:10,599
Cause they're so damn complicated and they get in the way all the time and when someone gets in the way of what you're doing

267
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:13,699
You know, it isn't obvious what they're interfering with

268
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,660
It might be the little micro-routine that you're undertaking right now

269
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,720
You know, maybe you go home and you make a nice dinner and the person you're making it for is all rude about it

270
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,814
Okay so what exactly are they getting in the way of?

271
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:27,134
Well

272
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,820
They're certainly getting in the way of your expectations of having a nice emotional time for the next hour

273
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,880
But you have no idea how indicative that is of some serious flaw

274
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,674
In you, or them, or the relationship, or the situation, or the way you've conducted your whole life

275
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,974
Or the way they've conducted their whole life

276
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,119
and all of that's packed in there

277
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,259
It's sort of like the unconscious of the psychoanalysts

278
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,440
but it's more - it's not the same conceptualization. It's another way of looking at the same phenomena

279
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,359
So

280
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,099
Alright so the two people we're going to talk about most are Medard Boss

281
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,180
And he was influenced by Martin Heidegger, who was a great philosopher

282
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,539
Taken to task often because he turned out to be tangled up with the Nazis more than he should've been

283
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,180
And Husserl, that's Edmund Husserl, who was actually if I remember correctly was Martin Heidegger's teacher

284
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,500
That's Ludwig Binswanger - and they were

285
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:24,925
Both of these two people were influenced both by Freud and Jung

286
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,240
Okay so here is one of Binswanger's claims

287
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,579
I love this claim it's such a cool idea

288
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,960
And I think there is neurological support for it. Neuropsychological support

289
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,360
What we perceive are "first and foremost" not impressions of taste, tone, smell or touch

290
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,960
Not even in things or objects, but meanings

291
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,615
Well that's an interesting idea

292
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,439
Because

293
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:53,980
You know it's been said that every person in an unconscious exponent of some great philosopher's presuppositions

294
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,400
Well, mostly the way you think about the way you perceive is that there are objects in the world

295
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,740
You see the objects

296
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,200
You think about the objects, you evaluate the objects

297
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,940
You decide how to act on the objects, and then you act

298
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,839
Right? it's from

299
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,619
Object, sense, perception, emotion, cognition, action

300
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,579
That's wrong. That isn't how it works

301
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,899
It's partly not the way it works because

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,019
You're actually - the way that you interact with the world exists at multiple levels

303
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,079
So for example

304
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,580
You have reflexes so if I

305
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,899
If I poke you hard, you'll react like that. You'll jerk back

306
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,960
And that, you do that without thinking

307
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,160
That's part of a neurological circuit that's very deeply embedded and that's virtually automatic

308
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,340
It's reflexive. It doesn't require conscious perception at all

309
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,500
It's too slow for starters

310
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,079
And so you have - there's multiple levels of you interacting with the world.

311
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,519
And at one level, you're seeing objects, you're thinking about them, you're planning what to do

312
00:20:54,619 --> 00:21:00,599
But you're doing all sorts of other things that are way faster than that and other things that are way slower at the same time.

313
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,639
Now what Binswanger claims

314
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,960
Is that what you see in the world are meanings

315
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,960
So it's the meaning detection first and the object recognition second

316
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,119
Now that's a hell of a claim, that is

317
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,779
But there's definitely levels of your nervous system

318
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,659
That operate in that manner

319
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,600
So for example

320
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,519
Here's a good example, people have blind sight

321
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,579
There visual cortex is damaged they can't see objects

322
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,879
So they think they're blind

323
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,140
But if you show them an angry face, they'll manifest a change in the skin conductants, They'll orient

324
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,819
And it means that the eyes are still mapping the face onto the amygdala

325
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:43,779
And the amygdala is mapping the pattern onto the body, no object perception

326
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:44,740
Pattern

327
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,660
Pattern

328
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,639
Pattern

329
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,279
No object perception

330
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,259
And so the meaning is what's being perceived first and foremost

331
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,320
And you have to perceive meanings first because you actually want to stay alive

332
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,779
That's the trick

333
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,120
So the world is full of these things that have meanings to you that are relevant to your survival

334
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,200
And what you're perceiving first is the relevance of the pattern to your survival

335
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,405
And the idea that you can conceptualize that as a set of objects

336
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:14,700
Well first of all, that's a pretty new idea

337
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,480
Technically speaking, right? Because

338
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,480
Technically speaking we didn't really start to conceive the world as subject in an objective world until we really formalized science

339
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,980
Now science was implicit long before it became explicit

340
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,339
But it didn't become explicit until about 500 years ago

341
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,619
So you react to meanings

342
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,919
So here's an example

343
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,579
Babies

344
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,599
if you

345
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,880
If you have two surfaces and you put a piece of glass between them

346
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,120
You know, they're elevated

347
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,000
And you put an 8 month year old baby on the one surface so they can crawl

348
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,200
It won't crawl across the space

349
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,059
And you might say it sees a hole and won't crawl across it

350
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,819
But that isn't what it sees. It sees a place to fall off

351
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,019
Direct, that's direct perception

352
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:03,900
So when I see this for example

353
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,720
My eyes see that as a pattern

354
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,700
That pattern's on my retina it's propagated through my optic nerve

355
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,819
It's propagated into my brain, it's propagated onto my motor cortex

356
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,440
And the propagation is

357
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
This

358
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,664
That

359
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,779
Right? So I can pick it up

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And as soon as - when I look at that this is implicit

361
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,320
That's implicit in the perception

362
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,859
You think well why do you see that at the size and resolution you see it at?

363
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,199
That's why

364
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:36,974
So the fact that you see it that way has this implicit in it

365
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:39,865
It isn't that you see the object and match your hand to it

366
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,579
It's that matching your hand to it is part of the perception of the object

367
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,220
It's what gives the object meaning

368
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,579
And so you see actually you perceive the meaning of the object

369
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,200
It's part of the perception

370
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
And you can't not see the meaning of the object

371
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:58,599
Well if you're a scientist you can sort of separate out the object from its meaning

372
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,179
That's actually what science does

373
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,640
It tears the object away from its meaning

374
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,339
And then of course there is nothing meaningful left

375
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,940
So science ends up value free. But that's because the meaning has been torn out of it

376
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,980
Now there's technical reasons for doing that

377
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,579
But Binswanger's point is don't kid yourself you see the meaning first. Here's an example

378
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,279
You watch the trade towers fall

379
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,359
What did you see?

380
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,380
Well you could say you saw the towers fall

381
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,120
It's like why are you in shock for two days afterwards then?

382
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,339
Well because what are the towers exactly?

383
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,879
As long as they're standing and operating, they're towers.

384
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,740
As soon as they fall, God only knows what they are

385
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,035
Maybe they're the beginning of the next war

386
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:43,045
You know? Who knows what they are?

387
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,500
And so everyone was in shock for three days

388
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,180
Because what they saw was the indeterminate meaning of that event

389
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
And it opened all sorts of gateways

390
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,140
It's like well, the towers fell, there's gateways open everywhere.

391
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,900
We don't know what's going on. We don't know what's going to happen next. We don't know where we are

392
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,039
And that's direct perception mapped onto your body. Bang, you're in shock

393
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:05,539
You see the meaning first

394
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,019
And well you constrain it down to well why are you so upset?

395
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,240
Well the towers fell

396
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,240
It's like that's the best you can do for a verbal utterance

397
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,579
It's what your perceptual systems reported to you

398
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,080
But God only knows what happened

399
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,160
We still don't really know what it meant that they fell

400
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,379
Now most things have put themselves back together but

401
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:30,019
And then you think well what does it mean?

402
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,900
What does it mean that what you see first is the meaning?

403
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,519
and that's a really tricky question because you might say well

404
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,319
That's when you get back to the problem of what constitutes real

405
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,660
So I could say well you've evolved to see the meaning

406
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,300
Well then we might ask

407
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:49,940
Well if you've evoled to see the meaning and that's kept you alive

408
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,000
Is there anything more real than the meaning?

409
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:55,404
Because somebody who is a materialist would say "well no, the object is more real"

410
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,980
It's like no, it depends on how you define real

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,519
It might be that the most real thing about the visual cliff is that that's a falling off place

412
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,879
And that its secondary description as a you know an object

413
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
A hole or something like that

414
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,519
That's something you paint over the top of the primary reality

415
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
And so,

416
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,680
Well here's a practical application of it or at least one of the things I think is practical

417
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,180
You know, you can have experiences that differ in their, lets call it, high quality meaning

418
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:29,759
You know so you get engaged and engrossed in something and you're happy about that

419
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:30,779
It's not that you're happy

420
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,559
It's that you're engaged and engrossed in it, you would do it again

421
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,960
Even though it might take effort

422
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,740
You can tell that where you are is meaningful

423
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,720
Well I think what happens in that situation is that

424
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,000
You're in a Piagetian place

425
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,639
Where many of the games that you're playing are stacked sort of isomorphically on top of one another

426
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,115
And the experience of meaning is the fact that you're playing a small game properly

427
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,979
Nested inside a larger game, you're playing it properly

428
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:01,359
Nested inside a larger game, you're playing it properly too, etc all the way out

429
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,640
Past is balanced, future is balanced everything is stacked up

430
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,279
And there's a report coming from your being telling you that, that's why you're engaged

431
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:15,359
You might say well maybe that's real. Maybe it's more real than anything else

432
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,699
That's a strange thing because if you think that meaning is separate and secondary from the real objective world

433
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,980
Then the reality is the object

434
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,700
But it isn't obvious that the reality is the object

435
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,819
It's certainly not how we act

436
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,659
It's not how we perceive

437
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:34,365
And so

438
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,240
Did we evolve to perceive reality? It depends on what you mean by perceive

439
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,859
Perceive might mean did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us to survive in the face of that reality. Yes.

440
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,179
Is that whats real? What enables you to survive in the face of reality?

441
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:53,144
It's a definition

442
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:57,055
It's a perfectly reasonable definition unless you can come up with a better one

443
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,045
Meanings are primary

444
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:03,259
Now that brings up a strange issue

445
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,295
So what determines the meaning of what it is you're perceiving

446
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,879
Well this is where Binswanger and Boss disagree

447
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:12,480
Binswanger says

448
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,339
It's the a-priori ontological structure. The world design, or matrix of meaning

449
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:20,019
Okay so what does that mean?

450
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,759
Well, you have a particular history. Biological and cultural and individual

451
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,720
And you're viewing the world through the lense of that set of particularities

452
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,099
So it's almost if you are behind a curtain and the curtain has certain hoels in it

453
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,000
And you can see through the wholes in the curtain

454
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:45,500
but the curtain is your construction so the curtain with the holes determines what you see

455
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,940
Well, Boss would say no it's the opposite in a very strange thing

456
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,460
The meaning of the world manifests itself to you more or less of its own accord

457
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:56,704
And

458
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:59,445
It's a tougher one to explain

459
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,500
Disclosure of meaning: Boss the revelation of the object

460
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,719
The emergence of the phenomena: the numinous

461
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,000
The very word phenomena is derived from phainesthai

462
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,660
To shine forth, to appear,  to unveil itself, to come out of concealment or darkness

463
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Okay here's an example you see someone beautiful

464
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,404
Is it your perception

465
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:25,125
is it your perception or does the beauty exist?

466
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,299
That's the difference between Binswanger and Boss

467
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,980
Cause Binswanger would say well the reason that thing appears to you as beautiful is because of the way you're filtering it

468
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,839
And Boss would say no

469
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,019
The beauty inheres in the object itself and manifests itself. It shines forth

470
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,279
And so I really like this concept this concept of phenomena

471
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,799
That's why they're phenomenologists

472
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,679
phainesthai means to shine forth

473
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:54,680
From the phenomenological perspective you pursue those things that shine forth

474
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,579
Now you remember this is kind of a parallel idea

475
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,140
I suppose it's a parallel of Jungian ideas

476
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,200
You remember in Harry Potter that when they're playing Quidditch he's always chasing the snitch?

477
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:10,795
And you remember how, if I've got this correctly,

478
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,299
Quidditch is basically two games at the same time right? There's the standard game and there's the game that the seekers play

479
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,179
Yes? I've got that right?

480
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
What happens if the seeker gets the snitch?

481
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,159
Games over right? They win

482
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,819
Very interesting. She has a brilliant imagination that woman, Rowling

483
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,839
So the idea is that in every game there's two games going on at the same time. There's the ordinary game

484
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,439
And there's the game that the seekers play and the seekers chase the thing that shines at them

485
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,480
And that's what that little thing is the snitch. It's a round circle with wings.

486
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,460
It's a very very old old old symbol

487
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,019
It's a symbol of what

488
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,180
It's a symbol of reality before it's fractionated into its parts

489
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,519
I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that

490
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:54,639
It's a symbol of

491
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,980
It's a symbol of

492
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,079
Imagine that there are things that move forward to make you curious

493
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,100
And you were trying to figure out what was common among all the things that made you curious

494
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,359
That thing that Harry Potter's chasing, that's a symbol of that

495
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,619
It's golden like the sun, it flits around and attracts your attention and it's always moving

496
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,720
And if you're seeking, you chase it.

497
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,039
So that's the phenomenological idea, that's the disclosure of meaning

498
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,319
You say well when you're curious about something, why are you curious about that?

499
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,159
Is it calling to you? Or is it something that you're interpreting?

500
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,819
Well I would say it's both

501
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,959
I think that's the way to resolve this puzzle

502
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:33,960
It's that

503
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,059
There isn't a perceiving entity without a structure

504
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,860
And your structure has been evolving itself for three and a half billion years

505
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,439
There's no perceiving entity without a structure

506
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,779
But by the same token the thing that's being perceived

507
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,559
Also shines forth with its own potential manifestation

508
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:54,359
And you need to think of it both ways at the same time

509
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,720
But the curiosity issue is a really fascinating one

510
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,740
Because curiosity pulls you forward

511
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,279
It's not random

512
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,899
That's the thing that's so cool

513
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,220
You can't really control it, but it's not random

514
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,519
If your curiosity is random, you're schizophrenic

515
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,180
And I mean that technically

516
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,160
Because one of the things that happens to schziphrenics is that the mechanisms that establish relevance become pathologized

517
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
And they see meaning everywhere, randomly

518
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,620
And that's partly why they generate delusions

519
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,259
Because the incoherent manifestation of meaning calls out for a representation

520
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:31,779
They develop a paranoid delusion if they're intelligent enough to put everything together

521
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,254
So you're curious and something pulls you forward

522
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:40,859
Well you can interact with the curiosity  and you can follow it but you can't really direct it

523
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,200
The question is where is it taking you?

524
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,159
So that little ball, that was a manifestation

525
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,440
Of what the Greeks referred to - Greeks? Is that right? - Mercurius

526
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,860
It's a Roman and Greek God Mercurius

527
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:58,279
The spirit Mercurius is the messenger of the Gods. The winged messenger of the Gods

528
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,759
It flits around

529
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,240
You say well the curiosity pulls you forward

530
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,380
To where?

531
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,940
Well to wherever it wants to take you

532
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,940
Well that's a Jungian idea as well

533
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:13,000
Is that your curiosity is like the manifestation of your self to the ego

534
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:18,740
Right? It's the thing that you could be in the future calling you forward

535
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,899
Something like that

536
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
Very strange idea

537
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,495
Very interesting. See when you start to understand

538
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,519
That you're not in control of what makes you interested in things

539
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:31,319
The whole world shifts around on you

540
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,259
Because the question is if you're not in control of that, what the hell is directing it?

541
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,059
What's going on?

542
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,339
It's not you

543
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:41,159
It's not under your control

544
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,459
It's not random. It's alive. It's dynamic

545
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,819
It has an orientation towards something

546
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,440
That's the Jungian self.

547
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,779
Or that's the manifestation of meaning

548
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,099
Yes very strange

549
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,559
I told you this already

550
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,579
See there's an old representation, a very old represenation of the snitch right there

551
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,279
Now this is an old symbol, eh?

552
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,279
You've got this dragon of chaos here

553
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,039
It's kind of like an octopus as well

554
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,519
That twist in its tail refers to infinity. Dragons almost always have an infinite tail like that

555
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,579
And it's got the claws of a bird, maybe a bird of prey

556
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,159
The body of an animal and the head of a snake

557
00:34:17,695 --> 00:34:19,025
And then down here

558
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:23,599
You see its got the sun up there so it's sort of aiming upwards towards the sun this thing

559
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:27,939
And then down here is this thing called the round chaos. It's an old alchemical system

560
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,960
And if you look the dragon is fertilizing this

561
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,934
And that has potential in it like an egg

562
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,864
It's full of potential

563
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,679
And so it's matter and spirit at the same time

564
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,619
It's sort of like it's a representation of that which you're exploring

565
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:47,639
Because you could say well the thing that you're exploring

566
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,319
It's sort of a constructivist idea

567
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,160
You explore something new

568
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,419
What do you generate from the exploration?

569
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:57,360
You. Because as you explore it you learn things. That changes you.

570
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,519
So you generate psyche out of the exploration. That's spirit.

571
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,880
And you also generate the world out of it

572
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,434
But the thing to begin with is psyche and world at the same time

573
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,179
And that's what this thing represents

574
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:10,059
And that's what Harry Potter is chasing

575
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,160
That's what makes him a seeker

576
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,660
Very strange ideas

577
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,039
Now I'm going to tell you a dream

578
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,880
There was a dream I had while working on these ideas

579
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,840
And I'm going to tell you the dream for two reasons

580
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,700
One is because it bears directly on these ideas

581
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:29,139
Two because well we just covered psychoanalytic thought and I want to show you how a dream can work

582
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,475
Cause it's not easy to find a dream that you can interpret in a way that's public that makes sense

583
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:36,474
Cause they're usually so tightly defined contextually

584
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,980
You can define them in the therapeutic context because you know so much about the person

585
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,914
It's very hard to pull that out and make it meaningful outside of that context

586
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,440
But this dream works. Ok so,

587
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:47,819
I was dreaming

588
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,000
I was dreaming that there was a small object. It was a circle, a sphere about this big.

589
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,480
And it was floating on top of the Atlantic Ocean

590
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:00,619
And I had kind of a birds eye view of it and I was following it along

591
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,799
Like maybe you know like a drone would follow behind an object

592
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,140
And it was floating

593
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:08,539
And it was really zipping along man, it was really really fast

594
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,619
And then the scene shifted

595
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,500
To a bunch of scientists they were sitting inside a room full of television monitors

596
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,860
And they were watching this thing move across the Ocean

597
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,460
And so it was here and it had four hurricanes beside it one here, one here, one here, and one here

598
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,500
So it was in the center of four hurricanes

599
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,880
So whatever it was was like some bloody potent thing zipping across the ocean

600
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,679
Then the scientists got a hold of it I guess and the scene shifted

601
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:39,759
And I was in a museum like an old Victorian museum

602
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,500
And this thing, this ball was now inside a

603
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,259
Imagine a wood stand

604
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,100
With a glass case on top of it

605
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,119
It was inside the glass case and it was floating and it was sort of pulsing a little bit

606
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,480
And so inside the room there was Stephen Hawking

607
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,960
And the American President

608
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,460
I don't remember who it was he was sort of faceless

609
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,179
But Stephen I thought, Stephen Hawking? What the hell

610
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,659
Disembodied intellect

611
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,760
That's Stephen Hawking so that's what that meant

612
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,579
And the President well he's just the symbol of order

613
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:17,799
And so this thing whatever it was that was surrounded by these winds

614
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,880
Had been placed into a category system right?

615
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,579
It was in a museum, it was boxed in. It had been conceptualized and categorized

616
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,259
Partly by disembodied intellect, that was Stephen Hawking,  and partly by social order

617
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,180
And so there's a Binswanger Boss thing going on there

618
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,159
The thing pulses and is alive so its got its own power

619
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,779
But it's also encapsulated in a category system

620
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,440
So I'm a third person observer in there I'm not in the room I'm just seeing this

621
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,400
So that was fine

622
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,860
So the next thing that happened

623
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,800
Oh yes, one of them described the features of the room

624
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,760
Its walls were seven feet thick

625
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,660
They didn't want this thing going anywhere

626
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:55,139
And it was made out of titanium dioxide

627
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,519
I thought, what the hell is that?

628
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,880
Well it's a paint

629
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,240
It's a paint substance but it's also what the hull of the Starship Enterprise is made out of

630
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,900
So my dream was saying well what's the hardest substance there is? Well it's titanium dioxide

631
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,619
It's not getting out of that box

632
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,919
The walls were designed to permanently constrain the object

633
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,775
Okay now the next thing that happened was this object was

634
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,580
You could tell it was kind of alive

635
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,899
And it kept shifting around and at one point it turned into a chrysalis you know a cocoon

636
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,940
And I thought what the hell does that mean?

637
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,840
And then, so it turned into a cocoon

638
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,460
And I don't know if you've seen a chrysalis when it's just about to hatch

639
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,039
But it twitches around eh? It's alive that thing

640
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,059
So they're very strange things

641
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,559
And then at the end it turned itself into a pipe

642
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,199
Like a Meerschaum pipe

643
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,460
And I thought

644
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,840
Then it reformed itself into a sphere

645
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,100
And just shot right out of the room

646
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,639
Like the walls weren't even there

647
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,139
It decided it was gone bang! It was gone

648
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,820
And I woke up and I thought what the hell

649
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,260
What the hell does that mean?

650
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,380
It took me forever to figure this out

651
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,860
So then about two years after experiencing this dream,

652
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,039
I was reading Dante's Inferno

653
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,199
In the ninth Canto, a messenger from God appears

654
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,259
So Dante goes down into hell right?

655
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,020
It was Dante's attempt to describe

656
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,059
It's brilliant

657
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,500
So imagine that you go to a bad place psychologically right?

658
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,539
So your life has collapsed that's terrible

659
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,579
But then you're trying to figure out what you did wrong and how you're to blame for it

660
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,860
And so what you do is a descent

661
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,300
A descent into your own foolishness and stupidity

662
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,860
Level, by level, by level

663
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,700
And that's what Dante was trying to explain

664
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,359
That's what that hell was

665
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,140
Levels of catastrophe and there's something right at the bottom

666
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,480
And he found that it was betrayal that was at the bottom

667
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,199
So in any case I was reading that

668
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,960
And there's a line in there that made me remember this dream

669
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,079
Cause I tried to figure out this dream for years eh

670
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,320


671
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:55,134


672
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:58,245


673
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:02,335


674
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:05,345


675
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:08,034


676
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,004


677
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,655


678
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:16,545


679
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:19,315


680
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:22,315


681
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,140


682
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,319
So that was like a herald of the arrival of this messenger

683
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,480
It's a very powerful scene

684
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,400
And I thought about this dream with this thing with the four storms

685
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,280
So

686
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,940
The pipe thing that really, that really took me forever to figure out

687
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,759
And I finally remembered this painting by Magritte

688
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,019
This is not a pipe

689
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,700
Right so what does that mean?

690
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,900
Well what it means is the representation is not the thing

691
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,219
It's a very famous painting right?

692
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,654
The representation is not the thing

693
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:03,064
Well even the perception is not the thing

694
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:04,900
And that's what the dream was trying to get at

695
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
It's like this thing

696
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,199
This thing that was so powerful and so capable of transforming

697
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,219
Could be encapsulated temporarily within a conceptual system

698
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:16,099
But whenever it decided to leave it was just going to leave

699
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
And so

700
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,739
What is was referring to was the potential that there is inside objects

701
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,960
So for example

702
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,740
And it's such a complicated thing to explain

703
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,280
Nobody knew what cell phones were going to do

704
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,480
You make the cell phone

705
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,719
You think you know what it is

706
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,319
You don't know what it is

707
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,880
No one knew what the birth control pill was going to do

708
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,300
You make it, you think you know what it is, you have no idea what it is

709
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,719
And it's going to do some of the things you think it will do

710
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:44,899
And it's going to do a bunch of things you have no idea about

711
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,480
And that's because

712
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,719
Things are more complex than they look

713
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,620
They're multi-dimensional and they have

714
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:54,440
I wouldn't say a life exactly but they have an intrinsic complexity

715
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,760
That tends to unfold across time

716
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,260
And it's only somewhat predictable

717
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,320
And so you have things under your control and in your grasp to some limited degree

718
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,720
But at any point it's like the switch in the yin yang symbol

719
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:09,179
At any time chaos can collapse into order

720
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,280
Or order can collapse into chaos

721
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,820
And that's what that dream meant

722
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,480
Another painting by Magritte trying to express the same thing right?

723
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,019
All men in suits, all uniform, all thinking the same way

724
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,219
Same haircuts, completely socialized

725
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:27,159
Blinded by their own perceptions

726
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,920
That's us

727
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,539
Cause you think well your perceptions illuminate and bring you information

728
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:34,360
It's yes and no

729
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,700
They also constrain to equal degree

730
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,599
I dreamed much later about a year later

731
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,460
This was a very cool image too

732
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,159
You know that image I think is it  Da Vinci or Michelangelo

733
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,960
Of the man inscribed in the square inside the circle

734
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,019
It's a very famous image

735
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,519
Well it was like that except

736
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,259
It was a cube and not a square

737
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,400
And so there was kind of a faceless person, almost like a mannequin inside this cube

738
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,599
And he was suspended about two feet off the ground

739
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,299
And on the front wall

740
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,779
It was like wall paper designs, there were these little squares about this big

741
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,019
And they mandalas square with circles inside them

742
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,800
And then inside the circle there was a little snake tail that was out

743
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,440
And the whole wall was covered with these snake tails

744
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,660
And the person

745
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,460
When the person walked forward the wall would move forward

746
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,800
And when he walked backwards the wall would move backwards

747
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,019
So it was always this far away

748
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:30,759
And he could reach out and pull any of those snakes into being

749
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:33,860
And so that was another dream of the same sort of idea

750
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,460
What do you have in front of you?

751
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,659
A world of objects

752
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:37,359
No

753
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,140
You have a world of potential in front of you

754
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,420
And you can interact with any aspect of that potential

755
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,380
And while you're doing so, you realize it

756
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,579
You pull something into being that wouldn't have been there before

757
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,039
And what you see in front of you is a wall of potential

758
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,380
The potential is not infinite because you're constrained

759
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,960
But, it's still

760
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:02,920
For all intents and purposes it will do you just fine it's more potential than you could ever need

761
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,200
And so the dream

762
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,340
See dreams

763
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,619
Dreams are at the forefront of thinking

764
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,680
They get there before you

765
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:16,579
The creative imagination is at the forefront of thinking

766
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,715
If you think that you're moving out into the unknown

767
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:21,339
To gather new information

768
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,800
What gets there first is the imagination

769
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,800
Obviously that's what Piaget says about children as well

770
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,400
You imagine it first

771
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,780
Then maybe you can represent it in speech

772
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,620
And a dream is part of that imaginative process

773
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:35,019
That's what artists are doing

774
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,739
They're going out into the unknown

775
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,820
And representing it imaginatively

776
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,220
So what does that painting mean?

777
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:44,159
Well if the artist knew that he'd just write it down

778
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,719
Right? The art is beyond what's articulable otherwise it's not art it's just propaganda

779
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:55,719
So the artist and the dream their out on the frontier right? That's the open imagination

780
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,260
And so when you're conceptualizing new things

781
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,720
The dream and the imagination can bring you places that you don't even know that you can go

782
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,339
And it's a mystery too

783
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,200
It's like I don't know how I figured this out

784
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,000
It was as if the figuring out manifested itself inside me

785
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,079
Cause that's the experience in a dream right?

786
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:14,779
You don't feel "I dreamed this up"

787
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,800
You feel "I had a dream." Where did that come from?

788
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,840
It springs out of the unknown and offers something to you

789
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,600
Here's pathology as conceptualized by the phenomenologists

790
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,534
It's a very interesting way of thinking about it

791
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:41,674
Existential guilt and fear as debt to possibility

792
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,500
Well so there's this idea

793
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,480
It's like an exisitential idea that you have some problems

794
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,960
That you have some problems in your life

795
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,880
Well part of the Dasein is the sense of responsibility that you have to address those problems

796
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,700
It's part and parcel of the way that human beings manifest themselves in the world

797
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:03,759
So part of your pathology would be failure to bear the responsibility for your being

798
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,140
And a sense that you have a debt to your existence

799
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,120
And according to the phenomenologists that's built right into the sense of your being

800
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,240
It's a remarkable conceptualization

801
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:24,254
Right well that's a good place to stop

802
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,204
Okay good we'll see you in a week and a half

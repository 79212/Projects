1
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,099
So,

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,359
I want to tell you about a book today.

3
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,859
The book is called "The Gulag Archipelago."

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,059
(to the camera crew) You ready?

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,240
(to the students) The book is called "The Gulag Archipelago," and it's by a

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,420
a Russian author... a Soviet author named

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,979
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,980
who

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,520
was in the Gulag Archipelago

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,780
concentration camp system for a very long time. He had a very hard life.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,420
He was on the

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,420
Russian front when the Germans

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,899
invaded the Soviet Union in the early stages of World War II. Now,

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,179
Hitler and Stalin had signed a non-aggression pact

15
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,479
and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union anyway.

16
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,780
And from what I've been able to understand,

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,020
the Soviets had prepared

18
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,799
an invasion force for Europe at that point but were

19
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,079
not concerned with having to defend their territory,

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,060
and so they were caught completely unawares by Hitler's move.

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,900
And the conditions on the Russian front were absolutely dreadful,

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,979
and Solzhenitsyn was soldier on Russian front.

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,299
He wrote some letters to one of his friends,

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,420
which were intercepted, complaining about the

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,359
lack of preparation, and using bitter dark humor to describe

26
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:43,920
the situation, and

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,920
the consequences of that was that

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
he was thrown into work camp.

29
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,159
The Soviet system relied on work camps,

30
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,019
and so those were large labor camps

31
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,420
of people who were essentially enslaved,

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,000
many of whom were worked to death — often froze to death — working

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,280
in conditions that were so dreadful, that they're virtually unimaginable.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number of years in these camps,

35
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,099
sometimes in a more privileged camp, because he was an educated man,

36
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,680
and sometimes in worse camps.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
He also

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
developed cancer

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
later, and wrote a

40
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,239
book about that called "Cancer Ward," which

41
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,060
is a brilliant book.

42
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,539
So, he had a very hard life.

43
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,539
There's just no way around that.

44
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,539
To be on the front, and then to be in a

45
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,979
concentration camp, and then to have cancer,

46
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:40,979
That's... that's pretty rough.

47
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,979
Now, he wrote "The Gulag Archipelago."

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,520
He wrote a book called "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" first,

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
that was published in the early 1960s,

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,260
when there was a brief thaw. Stalin was pretty much out of the picture by the end of the 1950s.

51
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,259
There’s some indication that he was murdered,

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,620
by Khrushchev, and Khrushchev became

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,480
a premier of the Soviet Union after Stalin.

54
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,019
And there’s some indication, perhaps, that Stalin was either murdered by Khrushchev and a set of his cronies,

55
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,180
or, when he was very ill, just before he died, was not helped, at least by…

56
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,420
wasn’t provided with any medical attention because of the

57
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,139
intervention of Khrushchev and his cronies. Now, there's some indication as well, at that point, that

58
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,399
Stalin, who was an absolute— absolutely barbaric in every possible way you could imagine,

59
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,319
was planning to start a third World War.

60
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
And he was certainly capable of doing such things, because he had already

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,759
imprisoned or killed tens of millions of people.

62
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Now...

63
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:54,560
just after Stalin died, there was a bit of a thaw in the Soviet Union with regards to internal repression.

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,159
In the early 1960s, Solzhenitsyn published a book called "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"

65
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,359
which was a story about one day in the life — his life, really — inside one of these so-called "gulag archipelago" camps.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Now, he called it the "gulag archipelago" because

67
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,479
an "archipelago" is a chain of islands, and so Solzhenitsyn likened the

68
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,959
work-camp system in the Soviet Union, which is made of isolated camps distributed across the entire state...

69
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,120
He likened that to a series of islands, and hence the metaphor.

70
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,120
And "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" was one of the first publications released in the Soviet Union that dared make public

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
what had happened inside these camps, at least initially.

72
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,079
Now, that thought didn't last very long, but that book had a tremendous effect.

73
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,079
It's a short book; it's worth reading.

74
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,439
After that, he spent— he wrote a number of other books which were also—

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,400
He's a great literary figure; in the same category, I would say, as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, which is,

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
like, really saying something, you know. Those two are perhaps the greatest literary figures who ever lived,

77
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,199
with the possible exception of Shakespeare.

78
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,279
He wrote this book called "The Gulag Archipelago," which is published in three volumes, each of which is about 700 pages long.

79
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:20,399
The first one details the origin of the oppressive Soviet system, at least in part under Lenin, and then its full-fledged implementation

80
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,719
under Stalin and the deaths of...

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,040
Well, Solzhenitsyn estimated the deaths in internal repression in the Soviet Union at

82
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
something approximating sixty million, between 1919 and 1959.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Now, that doesn't count the death toll in the second World War, by the way.

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Now, people have disputed those figures, but they're certainly in the tens of millions, and the low-end bounds are probably

85
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:50,799
twenty million, and the high-end bounds are near what Solzhenitsyn estimated... He also estimated that the same kind of internal repression in Maoist China

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,000
cost a hundred million lives, and so you can imagine that the genuine historical figures, again, are subject to dispute,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,519
but somewhere between fifty and a hundred million people. And one of the things that's really surprising to me

88
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,120
and that I think is absolutely reprehensible — absolutely reprehensible — is the fact that

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
this is not widespread knowledge among students in the West.any of these

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
it's because your education -

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
your historical  education

92
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Establishing the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor.

93
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,860
One of the things that's quite interesting about the gulag camps, and this is something that's very relevant to understanding modern Russia is that

94
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,300
so, ordinary criminals were put into the camps, and so were political prisoners.

95
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:40,879
but the ordinary criminals, and so those would be rapists and murderers, let's say, as well as thieves

96
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,480
who were engaged in theft as an occupation.

97
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Those were regarded by the Soviets as "socially friendly" elements.

98
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,920
And the reason for that was that they assumed that the reason that these people had turned to crime was because of the oppressive nature

99
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,179
of the previous Czarist/Capitalist system. And that the only reason that these criminals existed

100
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,879
was because they had been oppressed -- they were oppressed victims of that system

101
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,519
and so one of the convenient consequences of that absolutely insane doctrine

102
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,460
was that the Soviets put the ordinary criminals in charge of the camps.

103
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:17,739
And these were very, very seriously bad people, and so,

104
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,960
you can imagine the way that they treated the political prisoners

105
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,759
who were regarded as socially hostile elements,

106
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,120
sometimes because of their own hypothetically traitorous acts, but more often

107
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,539
merely as a consequence of their racial or ethnic identity,

108
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:35,419
or the fact that they were related by birth to, say, people who had been succcessful

109
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
under the previous systems, so who had any

110
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:43,539
any association with nobility or any association with were known as the Kulaks,

111
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:47,179
who were the only successful class of former peasants in the Soviet Union.

112
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,779
Because they were regarded as "privileged."

113
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,419
You may have heard that word more recently.

114
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:59,299
They were regarded as "privileged" and therefore as enemies of the state. And it didn't matter if it was your father, or your grandfather, or your great-grandfather

115
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,519
who happened to be "privileged,"

116
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:08,680
but the mere fact that you were a member of that group was sufficient reason to put you into a camp.

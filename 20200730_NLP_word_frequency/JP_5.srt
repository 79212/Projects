1
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:20,028
so I think the best way to continue to walk you through the thinkers that we're

2
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:25,829
planning to cover is to do that with examples they stick better and they're

3
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,028
more interesting and it's very difficult to understand you outside of a narrative

4
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,409
context and so I'm going to walk you through the Lion King today how many of

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,140
you have seen the Lion King yes so how many of you haven't right okay so

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,929
so you obviously were raised in a box somewhere out in the middle of field so

7
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,519
anyways you know it's it's it's an amazingly popular animated movie I think

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,149
it was the most highest grossing animated movie ever made made until

9
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,520
frozen which I actually absolutely detested but the Lion King The Lion King

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,300
is actually consciously influenced by archetypes as well as unconsciously

11
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,140
influenced by them so it's a bit of a cheat I would say in some sense but it

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,739
doesn't I don't for the purposes that we're using it for I think it's just

13
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:17,489
fine and so partly what you might think about is that it's its relationship to

14
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,438
archetypal themes that made it so overwhelmingly popular it's same being

15
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,029
the case with say books and movies like Harry Potter or the entire Marvel series

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,409
the Marvel series is quite interesting I know somebody who wrote for Batman and

17
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,280
for Wolverine I know Batman he's into Marvel comic but one of the things that

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,790
he told me that was quite interesting was that once these characters take off

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,930
and establish a life of their own they have a backstory and which becomes part

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,500
of the mythology that's collectively held by the readers and if you you can

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,099
invent an alternative universe where you can muck about with the backstory but

22
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,828
otherwise you better stick with it or the readers are gonna write you and tell

23
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,039
you that you've got the story wrong and so there's a bit of a collaboration

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,310
between the writers and the readers after these things take on a life of

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,129
their own and so and of course the they they tend to the the comic books in

26
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:08,758
particular tend to tend towards mythological themes very very rapidly

27
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,469
and so anyways Carl Jung was a fascinating person I think

28
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,300
you can read his biography autobiography / biography which is called memories

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,990
dreams and reflections which in many ways I think is an unfortunate book

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,980
because it's usually the only book that people read that's that is more or less

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,989
by young but and it is more popular yet popularly accessible which is probably a

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,170
good thing but it's also it's not as rigorous as his other books and so the

33
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,079
problem with someone like Jung is you kind of have to read him as much as you

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,380
can in the original because interpreting him is not a very straightforward matter

35
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,979
he was a very visionary person by which I mean he had an incredible visual

36
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,879
imagination and he used that a lot he used it in his therapy practice I

37
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,310
believe that most of his therapy clients were high in trade openness I have a lot

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,979
of clients who are high in trade openness they kind of seek me out

39
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,429
because I'm high and trade openness and you know they watch my videos and that

40
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,560
sort of thing and they're interested in what I'm doing and many of them are

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,640
astute dreamers and prolific dreamers and many open people in my experience

42
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,419
have archetypal dreams whereas people who are lower in openness they either

43
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,929
don't dream at all or they don't remember their dreams as much or they're

44
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,719
not interested in them and they're not interested in the mythological

45
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,289
underpinnings of them so I've taught psychology roughly speaking to many

46
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,099
different types of people including lawyers and lawyers and physicians and

47
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,489
they tend to be higher in trade conscientiousness than in openness and

48
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,450
they're much more interested in the practical applications of psychology and

49
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:45,569
maybe the big five theories than they are in the narrative underpinnings and

50
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,609
you know people say that when they went to um-- they had union dreams but I

51
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,850
don't and then when they went to Freud they had Freudian dreams and I don't

52
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,969
really believe that's exactly true I think it was a matter of selection bias

53
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,049
a priori selection bias on the part of the people who were likely to go see

54
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,290
either of those two and so but I've been struck by some clients in particular how

55
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,759
unbelievably continually they can generate deep archetypal dreams with a

56
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,108
really coherent narrative structure it's really phenomenal and how revealing

57
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,379
those dreams our problem with archetypal dreams is that they're not really

58
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,889
personal right so if you're looking for a personal way out of a situation an

59
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,129
archetypal dream doesn't help you that much because it gives you the general

60
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,769
pattern rather than a specific solution to your problem

61
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:35,399
but a good dream will do both at once anyways yung was an astute student of

62
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,139
Freud's I will cover Freud next although generally and in personality courses the

63
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,449
the order is reversed Freud first menuing because of their temporal of the

64
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,319
temporal order of their thought but I think it's better to start with Jung

65
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,579
because it's it's as if you Freud excavated into the basement and then

66
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,439
Jung excavated into many many floors underneath the basement of the mind and

67
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,149
so from if you're transitioning from an archaic understanding of archaic modes

68
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:07,169
of thinking towards Freud it's better to go through young because Jung is I think

69
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,699
I think Freudian theory is a subset of Jungian Theory fundamentally just like

70
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,409
Newtonian physics is a subset of Einstein Ian's physics and I think that

71
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,520
Freud knew that even to some degree although he was very much opposed to any

72
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,539
sort of religious thinking or mythological religious thinking I would

73
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,740
say he was a real 19th century materialist and he didn't like the fact

74
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,660
that Jung's work started to delve into religious themes in a manner that

75
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,350
actually in some sense validated those themes and so that's actually why they

76
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,710
split they split when you published a book called symbols of transformation

77
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,789
Jung was also a deep student of Nietzsche Nietzsche wrote a book called

78
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,620
thus spake Zarathustra which is kind of an Old Testament revelation poetry kind

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,949
of book it's a strange one and I wouldn't recommend if you want to read

80
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,899
Nietzsche that you start with that one but most people do but you get a seminar

81
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,339
on thus spake Zarathustra which is about I've got this wrong it's somewhere

82
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,719
between 700 and 1100 pages long and it only covers the first third of the book

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,030
and thus spake Zarathustra is actually quite a short book and so well so you

84
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,019
can imagine how much you had to know about Nietzsche to derive that many

85
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,539
words out of that few words and Nietzsche was a well an absolute

86
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,500
absolute genius and Jung was actually trying to answer the question that

87
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,819
Nietzsche posed fundamentally which is why part of the reason why it's

88
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,089
incorrect historically to consider him a Freudian he was so nietzsche basically

89
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:40,829
stated let's say explicitly that scientific empiricism / rationalist

90
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:44,459
had resulted in the death of the mythological tradition of the west

91
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,109
roughly speaking that's Nietzsche's comment on the death of God and in that

92
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,800
comment he also said that the fact that God was dead was going to produce

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,020
tremendous idiy a tional and social historical upheavals that would result

94
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,219
in the deaths of millions of people that that he didn't say all that in one place

95
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,919
it's it's spread between part of its in will to power and and I can't remember

96
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,329
the source of the other one some of its referenced and thus spake Zarathustra

97
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:16,139
but Nietzsche believed that in order to overcome the collapse of traditional

98
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,800
values with the idea say of God as its cornerstone people would have to become

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,250
creatures that could produce their own values as a replacement that we would

100
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,918
have to become capable of generating autonomous values and Jung but but

101
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,218
that's easier said than done because trying to impose a set of values on

102
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:38,399
yourself is very difficult because you're not very cooperative and you know

103
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,068
that if you try to get yourself to do something that you don't want to do or

104
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,330
that's hard you just won't do it and so it's not like you can just invent your

105
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:48,870
own values and then go along with that that just doesn't work and so what Jung

106
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,800
and the Freudians did Freud first I would say was to start looking to be

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,340
looking into people's fantasies autonomous fantasies unconscious

108
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:04,168
fantasies to see if they could - and and discover that values bubbled up of their

109
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:07,769
own accord into those fantasies and you can imagine for example if you've become

110
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,430
enamored of someone that you might start fantasizing about them and if you read

111
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
off the fantasy then you can tell what you're after and what you're up to and

112
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,860
so the motivational force composes the fantasy and Freud was more interested

113
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,270
not in a personal sense so in in so far as your fantasies might reveal your

114
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:28,109
personal history so for example if you have a burst of negative emotion in the

115
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,169
clinical session there'll be a fantasy that goes along with that an association

116
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:36,088
of ideas that that that kind of manifest themselves of their own accord and

117
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,510
they're not necessarily coherent and logical they're linked by emotion that's

118
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,049
the free association technique in Freudian psychology and they also might

119
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,799
manifest themselves in dreams and fantasies and so Freud started doing the

120
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,019
analysis of these spontaneous let's call them fantasies and Jung link that more

121
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,750
at Freud did this first with the oedipal oedipal

122
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,799
complex but then you linked up spontaneous fantasies and dreams with

123
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,299
with myth mythology and fantasy across history and of course Piaget did the

124
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,318
same thing from a completely different standpoint so and that a lot of that's

125
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:12,659
embedded in this movie so we might as well just walk through it so the first

126
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,159
question might be well why is a lion a king right and because it makes sense to

127
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,879
people that a lion could be a king and of course a lion is an apex predator and

128
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,480
so which means it's at the top of the food chain roughly speaking and it's

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,350
sort of golden like the Sun so that's also useful and you know it has that

130
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,009
Mane that makes it look majestic and of course it's very physically powerful and

131
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:37,649
it's it's and and and it's intimidating and so it's something that you run away

132
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,879
from as well right or you're awestruck by so the fact that you know it's like

133
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,839
snail king just doesn't make any sense right but lion king that works and and

134
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,769
you got to think about those things because it's not self-evident why a lion

135
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,568
would work as a king but uh but a snail wouldn't but it fits in with the your

136
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:58,649
metaphorical understanding of the way the world works much better and so the

137
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:03,720
Lion King makes sense and well and when things like that that aren't rationally

138
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,370
self-evident makes sense you have to ask yourself in what metaphorical context do

139
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,959
they make sense so you have the Lion King now the movie opens with a sunrise

140
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,859
and the sunrise is equivalent to the dawn of consciousness so that in many

141
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,100
archaic stories the Sun was a hero like Horus if I remember correctly was a

142
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:30,778
solar king but but Apollo in particular but Apollo Greek Greek myth the idea was

143
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:37,350
that at the Sun was this was the the hero the hero who illuminated the sky in

144
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,399
the day and so heroism and illumination and enlightenment are all tangled

145
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,220
together metaphorically and then at night what would happen would be that

146
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,930
Sun would fight with the with the dragon of darkness basically or with evil all

147
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:53,039
night and then rise again victorious in the morning and so it's a death and

148
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,360
rebirth theme and it's very very very very common mythological theme and the

149
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,600
reason the Sun is associated with consciousness as far as I can tell is

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,379
that were not nocturnal creatures right we're awake during the day and we're

151
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,278
very very visual half our brain is devoted to visual processing and to be

152
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,778
lightened and illuminated means to develop to move towards a higher state

153
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:17,698
of consciousness and we naturally use light symbolism to to represent that you

154
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:21,299
know like the light bulb on the top of someone's head you know you don't say I

155
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,889
was in darkened when you learn something new and so again that fits into this

156
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,720
underlying metaphorical substrate that that's I think deeply biologically

157
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,430
grounded but but also social or socially grounded so it's a new day it's the

158
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:39,838
start of a new day and a day day actually means like French your name

159
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,300
means day the day trek in some sense and how to comport yourself during the day

160
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,248
is the fundamental question the day is the canonical unit of time and so you

161
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:53,159
have to know how to comport yourself during the day and part of that is a

162
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,249
journey from consciousness into unconsciousness and that's and that

163
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:01,558
return so like Apollo you you've you descend into unconsciousness and then

164
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:04,980
re-emerge and of course that's not metaphorical at all that's exactly what

165
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,089
you do you descend into the underworld of darkness and dreams and strange

166
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,959
things happen down there and so and then you awake if you're fortunate or

167
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,008
unfortunate depending on your state of mind you awake in the morning and it's a

168
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,139
new day right and so the dream world seems to help you sort out your thoughts

169
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,980
by the way if you keep people awake for an extended period of time then they

170
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,199
they they they lose their minds essentially the dream that the

171
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:34,438
unconsciousness and the dream state seem absolutely critical in the maintenance

172
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:38,188
of mental health although people don't exactly understand why it looks like

173
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:42,299
dreams might help you forget because forgetting is really important you just

174
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,688
can't really wait you just can't remember everything that happened to you

175
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:49,740
gets today I'm cluttered that that you you'd fall apart and so you reduce

176
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,129
things to the gist and when you're doing that you pack them in it's like you

177
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,519
compress them in some sense you pack them into a smaller space and get rid of

178
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,808
everything that isn't relevant and the dream seems to not be part of that it

179
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,928
also seems to be a place where you deeply encode learning that might have

180
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:07,139
been done that day which is something that Freud actually noted in his

181
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,198
interpretation of dreams which is a great book if you're ever gonna read a

182
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:13,828
book that Freud wrote the interpretation of Dreams is the proper one to read in

183
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:17,578
my estimation it's a brilliant book and it laid the groundwork for a lot of what

184
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,139
Jung did and so anyways that's how the movie starts and the animals come out in

185
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,840
to the light and that's that's a metaphor for the dawning of

186
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,129
consciousness to come out into the light where you can see and so this is a baby

187
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,750
giraffe and babies emerge into the light roughly speaking and that's that's like

188
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,860
I said that that's a representation of the emergence or expansion of

189
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,039
consciousness and so this is how the movie starts it starts a very expansive

190
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,029
music as well celebratory music and that's to indicate

191
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,990
to you to set the tone for the movie but also to indicate to you that you're

192
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,009
about to watch something of import and the opening scene is actually a real

193
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,250
scene of genius in my estimation the animators did a great job and it goes

194
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,779
along very nicely with the music and so you see this little a sand then you see

195
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,129
this rock Pride Rock I believe it's called and in the middle of it and it's

196
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,909
the center it's the center it's like the spot that's marked by a cathedral which

197
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,299
is an X or a cross and you're right in the middle of that and so it's the

198
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:15,779
center of the light that's another way of thinking about it or it's the center

199
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:20,039
of the territory or it's the home or it's the fire in the in the wilderness

200
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,029
or it's the tree in the center where you live it's all of those things at once

201
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,459
it's inhabited territory with you at the center and the rock represents tradition

202
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,980
because people tend to inscribe their traditions on rock right or to build

203
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,250
them into rock like the pyramid so you could think about that as a pyramid as

204
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,070
an Egyptian pyramid and it's the right way to think about it

205
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,040
you could also think about it as a dominance hierarchy with the apex

206
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,149
predator at the top and that's the lion so it makes sense that the lion would be

207
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,480
in the light on the rock that's a pyramid in the middle of the territory

208
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,590
right that makes sense to people psychologically so because that's what

209
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,180
the state is the state is a hierarchy with with something at the top that

210
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,779
occupies a space that has been illuminated and made safe by

211
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,589
consciousness that's what the state is and that's all represented right away in

212
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,420
this movie and all the animals come to to observe what's happening in the

213
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,319
pyramid and at the top because they need to know what happens at the top

214
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,580
partly to organize their world that's the pyramid but also to see how the

215
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,690
organizational principle works and that's why they're all gathering and so

216
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,980
they're gathering in the light in the morning to observe something new that's

217
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,399
going to be born that's of significant importance and that's the birth of the

218
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
hero and this little bird here Zazu right

219
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,828
the zoo is like Horus the Egyptian God who was a Falken and an I at the same

220
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:46,229
time he is the Kings I in this Kings eyes in this movie right he flies up

221
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,759
above outside of the pyramid so he can see everything that goes on and reports

222
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,539
to the King and so partly what that indicates is that the thing that's at

223
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,469
the top of the pyramid needs to be an eye and that's partly why you see an eye

224
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,980
on the top of the pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill it's exactly

225
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,339
the same idea or if you look at the Washington Monument which is a pyramid

226
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,720
at the top you see that it's capped with aluminum and you think well why aluminum

227
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,470
and the answer to that was it was the most expensive metal at that time and so

228
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,379
the notion is is that at the top of the pyramid there's something that actually

229
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,060
doesn't belong in the pyramid it's something that goes up above the pyramid

230
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,719
and can see everything and so you could think about it this way is that you're

231
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,528
gonna be in a lot of pyramids in your life dominance hierarchies and different

232
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:32,129
states and families and all of that and they'll arrange themselves into a

233
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,909
hierarchy and there'll be something at the top and the top is the thing that

234
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:40,919
can do well across hierarchies so it's not stuck in any one pyramid it and it's

235
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,870
partly associated with vision and the ability to see a long long distance also

236
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,278
to see what you don't want to see and to report that back to the king and so the

237
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,720
king fundamentally as far as you guys are concerned from a psychological

238
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,528
perspective that's your super-ego that's the Freudian perspective or it

239
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,818
might be the moral system by which you comport yourself but your eyes are the

240
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:06,808
thing that updates that right you need it to orient yourself in the world you

241
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:11,609
need it to orient yourself among other people but your eye and your capacity to

242
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,058
pay attention especially to what you don't want to pay attention to is the

243
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,959
thing that continually updates that model exactly as Piaget laid out with

244
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,519
children so and all of that's packed into the imagery in the first you know a

245
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,629
few minutes of this movie and that's actually why it relies on imagery why

246
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,990
this isn't just a lecture by a psychologist you know when you go to see

247
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,890
the movie it's because the images they say a picture is worth a thousand words

248
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,509
but and there's thousands of pictures in this movie obviously but maybe a picture

249
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:43,529
is worth more words than you can actually use to describe it if the

250
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:48,210
pictures is is profound enough and we have many many pictures like that

251
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,350
any deeply symbolic picture is virtually inexhaustible in terms of

252
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:57,929
its of semantically with regards to its explanation images are very very dense

253
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,519
so anyways the animals all gather now the animals are also in representations

254
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,210
from the Freudian perspective and the it is the part of your psyche from the

255
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,059
Freudian perspective that's animalistic and and and full of of implicit drives

256
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,409
sexual and aggressive in particular as far as Freud was concerned and that's

257
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,759
because those two drives say unlike thirst or hunger are much more difficult

258
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,619
to integrate into proper social being and tend to be excluded and left

259
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,269
unconscious and so a lot of Freudian psychology and I would say psychology in

260
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:35,069
general is focused on the integration of sexual impulses and aggressive impulses

261
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:40,139
into the psyche I would also add to that anxiety because anxiety is also a major

262
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,910
problem anxiety and negative emotion that's pain like is also a major problem

263
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,050
for people and so the animals represent those it'd like impulses that have to be

264
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,970
organized hierarchically before you can become an integrated being and precisely

265
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,960
the piagetian manner right because Piaget would say well the child comes

266
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,730
into the world with reflexes and maybe a more modern psychologists would also

267
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,630
concentrate on the implicit motivations and those have to be organized inside

268
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,190
the child into some kind of hierarchy of unity before the child can organize him

269
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,120
or herself into the broader unity of the state and that's basically what's being

270
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:22,229
represented here and so so Zazu the eyes of the king comes to check out the King

271
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:28,230
and that's uh what's his name what's the King's name Mufasa yeah and he's a very

272
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,150
regal looking person lion and he stands up straight and tall and that means that

273
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,230
he's high in serotonin because serotonin governs posterior flexion and if so if

274
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,039
your dominant and near the top of hierarchies you tend to expand so that

275
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,549
you look bigger than then you could if you shrunk down and so if you're low

276
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,869
dominant person you wander around like this so that you look small and weak and

277
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,469
you don't pose a threat to anybody but if you're at the top you expand yourself

278
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,430
so that you can command the space and that's why he has that particular kind

279
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,880
of regal posture and if you look at his facial expression you see that it's

280
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,778
quite severe it like he's he's capable of kindness but he's also

281
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:07,048
harsh and judgmental and that's what society is like that's what the

282
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:10,440
super-ego is like and what that means is that he's integrated his aggression and

283
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,950
I've seen this happen in my clinical clients when they come in and they're

284
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,999
too agreeable they look like Simba looks later in the movie when he's an

285
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,989
adolescent and he's sort of like a deer in headlights everything is coming in

286
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:26,340
and nothing is coming out but when the person integrates their shadow and gets

287
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,038
the aggressive part of themselves integrated into their personality their

288
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,028
face is hardened and if you look at people you can tell because the people

289
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:36,690
who are too agreeable look childlike and innocent and the people who well a hyper

290
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,929
aggressive person will look you know mean and cruel but uh let's see if

291
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,580
that's good that's still working so but I've seen people's face changes change

292
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:53,489
face change in the course of therapy men and women so and what happens is they

293
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:57,298
start to look more mature and it's it's more like they're they're judging the

294
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,648
world as well as interacting with it properly once they integrate that more

295
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,878
disagreeable part of them it's very very necessary that's part of the

296
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:09,178
incorporation of the Union shadow or the incorporation of the unconscious from a

297
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,389
Freudian perspective but old Musa Musa there he's already got that he's already

298
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:20,269
got that covered so and he's capable of obviously he can smile and he's full

299
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:23,999
capable of the full range of expressions but he's a tough looking character and

300
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:29,489
and now this baboon here who's supposed to be basically just a fool when the

301
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,119
story was first written he turned into what's essentially a shaman across time

302
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:38,218
and so he represents the self from the Union perspective now the self is

303
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:42,359
everything you could be across time so you imagine that there's you and there's

304
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:46,378
the potential inside you whatever that is you know and potential is an

305
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:50,788
interesting idea because it's represents something that isn't yet real yet we act

306
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:53,788
like it's real because people will say to you you should live up to your

307
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:58,588
potential and that potential is partly what you could be if you interacted with

308
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:03,148
the world in a manner that would gain you the most information right because

309
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:06,478
you build yourself out of the information in the piagetian sense but

310
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:09,838
it's deeper than that - because we know that if you take yourself and you put

311
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,678
yourself in a new environment new genes turn on in your nervous system they

312
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,639
encode for new proteins and so you're full of biological

313
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:21,778
tential that won't be realized unless you move yourself around in the world in

314
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:25,469
two different challenging circumstances and that'll turn on different circuits

315
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,558
so it's not merely that you're incorporating information from the

316
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,548
outside world in the constructivist sense it's that by exposing yourself to

317
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:37,138
different environments you put different physiological demands on on yourself all

318
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:42,088
the way down to the genetic level and that manifests new elements of you and

319
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:45,388
so one of the things that happens to people and this is a very common

320
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:50,398
cultural notion is that you should go on a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere

321
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:54,658
central and that would be say like the rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King

322
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,229
because you take yourself out of your dopey little village and that's just a

323
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:02,009
little bounded you that everyone knows and that isn't very expanded and then

324
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:05,788
you go somewhere dark and dangerous to the central place and while you do that

325
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:10,648
you have adventures and they tough on you and pull more out of you like partly

326
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:15,748
because you're becoming informed which means in formation it means you're

327
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:19,440
becoming more organized at every level of analysis but there's also more of you

328
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,489
too and so that's a very classic idea and then in in cathedrals in Europe

329
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,899
especially at Chartres there's a big maze on the floor a circular maze which

330
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:31,648
is a symbolic representation of the pilgrimage for people who couldn't do it

331
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:36,118
and so it's a huge circle divided into quadrants which is a union Mandela and

332
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:40,348
you enter the maze at one point and then you have to walk through the entire maze

333
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:45,298
north east west and south before you get to the center and the center is

334
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:49,499
symbolized by a flower that's carved in stone it looks like this it's big this

335
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:54,358
maze a it's it's large so that you can walk it and that's a symbolic pilgrimage

336
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:57,958
it takes you to the center that's the center of the cross because it's in a

337
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:02,070
Cathedral and that's the point of acceptance of voluntary suffering that's

338
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:07,288
what that means and so you walk through you can call that a circumambulation you

339
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:12,989
go to all the corners of the world to find yourself and so well the self is

340
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:17,759
the baboon in this particular in this piece of mandrill actually in this

341
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,389
particular representation and he lives in the tree he lives in the tree of life

342
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:25,558
it's a bale bob tree in this particular so he's the spirit that inhabits the

343
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:30,298
tree of life and he's the eternal wise man that's a way of thinking so is the

344
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:33,389
king but he's sort of a superordinate king or an

345
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,950
outside king in some sense he's the repository of ancient wisdom and the

346
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,100
king is the manner in which that wisdom is currently being acted out in the

347
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,819
world and so they're friends and that means that the king is a good king

348
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,230
because if they if the king was a bad King he would be alienated from himself

349
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,190
and that would make him shallow and one-dimensional and that would make him

350
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,809
a bad ruler no Union with the traditions of the past to be a good ruler you have

351
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:02,009
to rescue your father from the underworld and integrate that and of

352
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:11,640
course that's a main theme in this entire movie so hey a new mystery to

353
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,880
solve

354
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:39,969
okay so the hero is born and that's what the Rising Sun represents and everybody

355
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,329
goes oh oh isn't that cute and the reason for that is because you're

356
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:47,079
biologically wired especially if you're agreeable to respond with caretaking

357
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:53,139
activity - cute - cuteness and cuteness button nose big eyes small mouths round

358
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,550
head symmetry and helpless movements and you'll respond to that across the entire

359
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,990
class of mammalian of mammalian creatures even maybe down to lizards you

360
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,630
know isn't that cute it's no it's a lizard but you know so so so that's an

361
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,130
archetype as well that's the archetype of the vulnerable hero at Bohr the

362
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,040
vulnerable hero newly born and that should invoke a desire mostly on the

363
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,269
part of males to encourage and mostly on the part of females to nur it to nurture

364
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:26,920
but males and females are quite cross wired among human beings and so there's

365
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,060
encouragement from the women and there's also nurturing from the men and of

366
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,109
course those those curves in some sense overlap so there's more nurturing males

367
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:39,519
and more encouraging females but that's roughly the archetype and so he looks

368
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,910
cute and everybody goes on and that's because the animators nailed that they

369
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,509
caught the essential features of cuteness and he's also in the light

370
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:53,680
right and so then the shaman mandrel basically baptizes him nots essentially

371
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,070
what he's doing and he uses something that symbolic of the Sun which is this

372
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:00,849
ripe fruit and fruits are symbolic of the Sun because of course they need the

373
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:04,869
Sun to ripen and they're round like the Sun and so and people know that they

374
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:09,549
need light but and and so anyways the animators make a relationship between

375
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:14,740
the fruit that the shaman is going to break and the Sun and so he's also being

376
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,519
baptized into the Sun and that means that he's being baptized into the light

377
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,139
or that he's being transformed into a hero and so then everyone's happy and

378
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,320
that's basically you know the divine father and the divine mother and the

379
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,369
divine son and the self who's taking care of that and there's a union between

380
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:35,229
the baby and the wise old man because the baby is all the potential that's

381
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,860
realized in the self and there's an old idea that the way to full maturity is to

382
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:46,689
find what you lost as a child and regain it it's a brilliant idea and that that

383
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,600
that echoes through mists all over the world and that means you have

384
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,319
to regain your capacity once you're disciplined and you know how to do

385
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,288
something you have to regain your capacity for play and sort of for

386
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,878
wide-eyed wonder and that's maybe the childlike part of your spirit and the

387
00:28:00,878 --> 00:28:06,609
reintegration of that childlike part with the adult grown-up part Reviva Faiz

388
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:10,298
the adult grown-up part and allows the child to manifest itself in a

389
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:13,658
disciplined way in the world and so that's all being hinted that there and

390
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:19,840
then they showed the shaman shows the baby the newborn hero to the crowd and

391
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,519
it's very cool what happens in the movie all the animals spontaneously Neil and I

392
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,759
can give you an example of that kind of spontaneous action in a crowd

393
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,669
it's imagine you're watching off gymnastics performance right and and

394
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,000
it's like at a high level world-class performance and someone comes out there

395
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,500
and they do this routine that's just dead letter-perfect you know and they

396
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,128
stop and everybody claps like mad right and it's perfect

397
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:48,128
and so then the next contestant comes out and they're basically in real

398
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:51,638
trouble because you know this person just got nine point seven out of ten and

399
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:55,658
it was perfect so how do you beat perfect and so will they come out there

400
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,330
and then you watch them and you're right on the edge of your seat because what

401
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,378
you see them do is something extraordinarily disciplined just like

402
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:06,158
the last person did but they push themselves into that zone that's just

403
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,120
beyond their discipline capacity and you can tell every second you're watching it

404
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,048
that they're that close to disaster and so you're right on the edge of your seat

405
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:18,250
and and you know that they're doing a high-wire act without a net and so when

406
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,298
they finally land triumphantly you'll all stand up and clap spontaneously and

407
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:26,099
it's because you've just witnessed someone who's a master at playing a game

408
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,369
who's also a master at improving how to play that game at the same time and

409
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,788
people love that more than anything to see that it's just absolutely

410
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:37,558
overwhelming because it's a testament to the human spirit and you'll respond

411
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:42,278
automatically and unconsciously to that and that's why that's an analogy to why

412
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:48,429
the animals all spontaneously bow when now what happens is they shows the Lion

413
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:53,440
King and the Sun breaks and shines on that the hero at the same time so

414
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,919
there's this concordance between an earthly event and a so-called heavenly

415
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,429
event and you would call that synchronous that's his idea of

416
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:04,570
synchronicity where something important subjectively is also

417
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,589
signified by something that appears in narrative keeping with that in the

418
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:12,279
outside world that's one of the most controversial elements of his theory but

419
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,059
I've experienced a variety of synchronous events and they often happen

420
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,500
in therapy especially around dreams but they're very hard to communicate because

421
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,819
they're so specific to the context in which it occurs they're very difficult

422
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:29,470
to explain so anyways it's the synchronous event that make drops all

423
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,910
the animals to their knees so there's the Sun coming out and there's shining

424
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,540
on them and all the primates go mad for that and that's of course exactly what

425
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:44,349
we do when we applaud and then we switch to scar now scar is mufasa's brother

426
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:48,819
evil brother the king always has an evil brother and so does the hero the hero

427
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,720
always has an adversary and the reason for that is the king always has an evil

428
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,610
brother and that means that the state always has a tyrannical element and the

429
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:02,889
tyrannical element exists for two reasons one is the state deteriorate of

430
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,900
its own accord and that's an entropy observation what that means is that the

431
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,640
state is a construction of the past right but the present isn't the same as

432
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,259
the past and to the degree that the past is mismatched with the demands of the

433
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,420
present then it's then it's then it's a tyrannical it's malfunctioning and so

434
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,250
it's it's a continual problem with the state it's always two steps behind the

435
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,809
environment and so then that means that the awareness of living people has to

436
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,069
update the state and so Eliot and Maria Eliot who's a great historian of

437
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:39,549
religions looked at flood stories from all over the world because there are

438
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,700
flood stories from all over the world partly because there are floods all over

439
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,720
the world but that's there's a psychological reason to so imagine that

440
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,860
New Orleans was wiped out by a hurricane right a flood didn't you say well that

441
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:55,359
was an act of God but then you think wait a second wait a second they knew

442
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,659
those dam dykes weren't gonna hold they knew they weren't built strong enough

443
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,650
they took the money that was allocated to the dikes and spent it badly and that

444
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,030
was willful blindness and so you could say that it was God who caused the flood

445
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:11,049
so to speak metaphorically but you could also say that it was the degeneration of

446
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,759
the state and the willful blindness of the politicians that call

447
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,690
the flood in Holland they build the dikes to withstand the worst storm in

448
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,460
10,000 years in the you southern US they built them to withstand the worst storm

449
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,019
in a hundred years and they knew that that was insufficient and so the flood

450
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,650
if there's a flood well you can say well that's an act of nature but you can also

451
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,759
say just wait a sec maybe if there was a flood because we looked the other way

452
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,230
and because our systems were out of date and that's why in flood stories there's

453
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,970
there's a continual theme which is the the people get wiped out by the flood

454
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:52,210
because God judges them harshly for their senility and their willful

455
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,640
blindness and it's a story that's very much you'll have a flood in your life

456
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,240
right it'll be a flood of chaos and you'll find of one form another and

457
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,349
you'll find when you investigate the causes of the flood that some of it will

458
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:08,379
be and sometimes this is cake the case it's just random

459
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,130
you just got singled out you got a terrible disease and that's the end of

460
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,190
you or something like that but there'll be other situations where the flood

461
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,940
comes and you're surrounded by chaos and you'll look into it you'll think I knew

462
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,620
this was coming I knew I wasn't paying attention I knew I hadn't sorted things

463
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:28,539
out and the consequences of that will have cascaded and wiped you out and then

464
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,690
you're in real trouble because not only did you get wiped out but you also know

465
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,620
it's your fault and that is not a good thing that makes you bitter and

466
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:40,750
resentful and murderous when that happens so anyways scar is scarred right

467
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,170
so what that implies is he's had a pretty rough life and he's kind of

468
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,980
skinny and he said he was born in the low end of the gene pool and so he has

469
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,220
reasons to be resentful he's also hyper intelligent and rational

470
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,769
and it's one of the things you see very commonly about the evil adversary of the

471
00:33:56,769 --> 00:34:01,359
state or of the individuals often intelligent and hyper rational and the

472
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,619
best commentator on that was probably John Milton and Paradise Lost because

473
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:10,119
that's how he represents Lucifer or Satan who's the spirit of rationality

474
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,679
and enlightenment strangely enough hence Lucifer the bringer of light and the

475
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,740
reason for that as far as I can tell and this is something that Milton figured

476
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,459
out when he compiled all these ancient stories about evil and tried to make

477
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,559
them coherent was that the problem with irrationality with rationality is that

478
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,739
it tends to fall in love with its own product

479
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,398
right and so then it comes up with a theory that makes that a totality and

480
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,929
then it won't let go so the rational mind has a totalitarian element and we

481
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,619
know that to some degree because that kind of rationality seems more left

482
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,240
hemisphere focused and the left hemisphere tends to impose structured

483
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,928
order on the world and be updated by the right hemisphere and the right

484
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,409
hemisphere generally updates it with negative information and with fantasy

485
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:57,579
and so the left hemisphere will impose a coherent structure on the world which is

486
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:01,569
really necessary for you live in it but the problem is there's a tension between

487
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,950
coherence and completeness and that's partly why you need two hemispheres you

488
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:09,759
need one to represent the world and you need one to keep track of the exceptions

489
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,740
and to feed those slowly into the representational system so that it so

490
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,709
that it can stay updated without collapsing into complete chaos

491
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:24,429
so anyways scar and he's got this like droopy mouth and this whiny arrogant

492
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:29,469
voice and he feels hard done by and he's resentful and and in in classic heroes

493
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:35,079
stories stories of the state as well the so this is an Egyptian take on it Osiris

494
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,000
was was the god of the state and set who later became Satan that name became

495
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,489
Satan as it transformed through Coptic Christianity Osiris had a brother named

496
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:51,039
set and set he didn't pay attention to set enough attention and set was always

497
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:57,039
scheme scheming to overthrow the kingdom just like scar is and the Egyptian said

498
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,029
straightforwardly that the reason that Osiris got overthrown by said he got

499
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,330
chopped into pieces and his pieces distributed throughout the state in the

500
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,529
mythological representation and those pieces were actually the provinces of

501
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,430
Egypt technically speaking so and that's what the Egyptians thought so that's

502
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:16,809
quite cool but the Egyptians said explicitly that the reason that Osiris

503
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,849
got overthrown by set was because he was willfully blind old senile and willfully

504
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:26,618
blind same idea as the flood myth you don't see that quite here because Mufasa

505
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:31,780
is sort of on to set or to scar but scar is more treacherous than Mufasa believes

506
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,900
and he gets at he gets at Mufasa by going through his son by by by playing

507
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,820
on on the impulsivity and and juvenile qualities of his son

508
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,750
so obviously there's some antagonism between these two as you can see by

509
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,460
their facial expressions there and there is a good example of scar you know he's

510
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,840
got that droopy kind of whiny malevolent face and that malevolent voice that

511
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Jeremy Irons pulls off so incredibly well and he's always skulking he's a

512
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,230
creature of the night he always skulks around he's not a creature of the day in

513
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,389
any sense of the word and you know obviously Mufasa is golden like the Sun

514
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:15,119
and scars dark like the night that's another thing another clue another hint

515
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,299
okay there's the tree that's The Tree of Life we already talked about that I

516
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,080
think that represents the multiple levels at which you exist simultaneously

517
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,670
all the way from the subatomic all the way up to the cosmic so to speak and

518
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,240
that's a different kind of dimension and that's the that's the place that the

519
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,849
self inhabits and it can kind of move up and down those dimensions but anyways

520
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:42,219
that the shaman lives inside that tree and and that's our first introduction to

521
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,639
him basically but he's the spirit of the ancient tree that's another way of

522
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,629
thinking about a very very common element in stories right the spirit of

523
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:56,349
the ancient tree and so all right so now Mufasa has taken taken Simba up to the

524
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:00,250
top of the pyramid right so that's the the aluminum place let's say or the

525
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,510
place of the eye where you can really see a long ways and he's explaining to

526
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,620
him what his kingdom is going to be and you see the Sun of course appears that

527
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,069
that to begin with and that's another hint about being at the top that's the

528
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,600
illuminated part of the pyramid and so they're up there talking and what Mufasa

529
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,039
tells Simba is that his kingdom is everyplace the light has touched and

530
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,969
that's so brilliant so one of the things you'll notice if you move into a new

531
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:29,529
apartment you're like a cat cats don't like changing houses and they have to

532
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,890
zoom around in every corner to see exactly what the hell's going on there

533
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:36,609
before they calm down they need to know where they can hide and where the

534
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,390
potential dangers are and what you'll find if you move into a new place that

535
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:44,559
you will not be comfortable there until you've investigated potentially cleaned

536
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,199
and repaired every single square inch of it the more attention you pay to it the

537
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,730
more it'll become yours and that's far more than mere like material ownership

538
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,880
which is also relevant but in order to feel comfortable

539
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,309
somewhere and to dominate that place to be in meshed in that place you have to

540
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:07,539
attend to it you have to shine light on every corner and you have to do that

541
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:10,809
with yourself and with your relationships as well and so anyways

542
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,579
Mufasa tells Simba that his kingdom is everything that the light shines on and

543
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:19,509
that's exactly right and then there's a metaphor there too which is that what

544
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,960
you've Shawn light on which is what you've come to understand and master is

545
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,250
surrounded by an Otherworld of all the things that you don't understand and

546
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,608
some of those would be natural things and some of them would be tyrannical

547
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:33,549
things and some of those would be things you don't want to know about yourself

548
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,570
but they're outside of where you've managed to shine the light and so that's

549
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,890
exactly what Mufasa tells Simba says we live in this pyramid we're at the top

550
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:46,539
there's a domain of light around it that's explored territory outside of

551
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:49,750
that there's explore unexplored territory and that's partly the

552
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,769
unconscious because you fill it with fantasy and it's partly what you just

553
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:59,079
don't know and then Mufasa tells Simba and it's sort of like God telling Adam

554
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,579
and even in the Garden of Eden not to eat the apple Mufasa tells Simba there's

555
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,809
that this outside place that's dark that's not part of your kingdom and you

556
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,559
should not go there and that's really interesting because Simba doesn't even

557
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,210
know about that place yet and so Mufasa is doing something very contradictory

558
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,010
there it's like telling him that it exists and and heightening his curiosity

559
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,270
but also saying that he should go there almost ensuring that that's exactly what

560
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:30,489
Simba is going to do you see this in the Pinocchio movie to where Pinocchio is

561
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:35,500
planning to jump into the ocean to go get Geppetto from the underworld and

562
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,920
he's following his conscience is along with him Jiminy Cricket

563
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,608
and the cricket is warning him about all the dangers that he'll face down there

564
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:46,358
and telling him that he will be fish food personally and while he's doing

565
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:49,299
that Pinocchio ties a knot around his donkey

566
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,170
tail around a rock so he can sink and and the little cricket helps him tie the

567
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,070
knot so well he's warning him about the adventure he's going to undertake at the

568
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,880
same time he's encouraging him to do it and there's that paradoxical thing which

569
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,410
is that if you go outside what you know it will cause a fall because it'll

570
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:08,858
damage your knowledge structures and you'll go down into chaos and that can

571
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:12,940
really destroy you so you should do it but by the same token if you do do

572
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,409
it and you do it successfully then the new you that are' arises can be stronger

573
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:21,579
and more complete than the previous you so you should do it and you shouldn't do

574
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,559
it and that's anyone sensible says look don't bother right but sensible isn't

575
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,000
enough that's the thing you have to also be not sensible enough in order to live

576
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,050
and your typical hero and Harry Potter is a really good example is always a

577
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:40,180
rule breaker always but he you know the rules he breaks are like there's

578
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:45,879
judicious nough speaking the hero breaks a rule in the service of a higher good

579
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,519
but he's still breaking the rules and that's what puts them outside the

580
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:55,659
boundary of the social of the social establishment so now at this point Simba

581
00:41:55,659 --> 00:42:00,789
also gets introduced to scar and that that that has two meanings one is that

582
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:04,960
scar is the tyrannical element of the state and so as a child when you're

583
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,070
being socialized you encounter the tyranny of the state and one of the best

584
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,120
you can't yet there's no way around it one of the best examples of that is that

585
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,179
children are always running around having fun and they're really bubbly and

586
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:21,369
and impulsive and joyous and playful and that causes a lot of trouble because

587
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:24,609
positive emotion is very disruptive they'll run around and break things

588
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,030
they'll hurt themselves and they'll get into trouble and so you're always saying

589
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,710
calm down sit down behave don't do that and it's it's not because they're crying

590
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,519
or angry it's because there's a day I'm happy and impulsive that no one can

591
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:40,989
stand them and so and so that's a tyranny it's like that the state puts

592
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:46,000
puts pressure on you to regulate your emotions positive negative and positive

593
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,960
and it crushes you it crushes the life out of you a lot of it and so you end up

594
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,559
you know your age and you're all mopey because the holes especially because

595
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,000
you've been forced to sit down in school for like 17 years you're all mopey and

596
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,539
it's no wonder you know you've had the spirit taken out of you by the process

597
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:05,230
of discipline but without that you'd be completely useless so it's another one

598
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:11,050
of those paradoxical you know gifts and and catastrophes that you encounter as

599
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,640
you move through life so anyways Simba look at how happy he is you know I mean

600
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:19,659
he doesn't know a damn thing he's so naive you can tell but oh look it's my

601
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:24,039
uncle Scar it's like you know and this is not a guy you smile at

602
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,230
clearly but he's all positive emotion and joy and enthusiasm and that's not

603
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,740
good because that means this character can take serious advantage of it and

604
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:37,029
that's exactly what he does and so scar pretends to be on his side which is what

605
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,680
a good pedophile always does by the way and so you know you you take advantage

606
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,579
of the child's trusting nature and openness in order to exploit them and

607
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,239
that's that's what horrible people do that all the time including the parents

608
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:53,259
of children and other children themselves so you know there's this

609
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,100
false I mean look at the animators are so damn brilliant Hey look at that

610
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,880
expression really like you know you just look at that and you think well that's

611
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,510
just a facial expression but of course it's not some damn animators worked

612
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,860
really hard to get that they're really observant and they distill the facial

613
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,539
looks like the face is right it covers the whole head and and they've got the

614
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:17,259
eyebrow lifts proper and they've got this horrible sanctimonious smile and

615
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,070
the tilt of the head then you know and he's sort of crushing him while he's

616
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,090
hugging him at the same time and really really and you know it took a lot of

617
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,600
thought for every single one of these frames to be put together right there's

618
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,500
a tremendous amount of cognitive effort that went into that so none of this is

619
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,719
accidental yeah well that pretty much says

620
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,709
everything it's like whoo I hate that kid and to hardly wait till he's gone

621
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,119
and didn't I pull one over on him you know it's a real testament to an adult's

622
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,429
genius when he can fool a kid so then Simba encounters the anima that's the

623
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,659
anima the Jungian anima and the anima is the feminine counterpart in the soul and

624
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:59,109
she well yeah you could tell what she does to him right because she's got this

625
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,880
supercilious and and what would you say judgmental and teasing look on her face

626
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,510
and she's really trying to put him down and it's work it like bad he's not very

627
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,500
happy about that at all and she's the thing this is what the anima does the

628
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:17,590
soul she's the thing that teaches the exploratory hero that that it's not

629
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,670
everything it could be right and that's part of this can be read multiple ways

630
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,650
but it's part of the eternal tendency of women to makes men self-conscious by

631
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,460
their sexual selectivity that's part of it because that makes men self-conscious

632
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,809
like nothing else and it's also perhaps been one of the phenomena that's

633
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:37,900
produced the evolutionary arms race in this in the

634
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,210
sex is among human beings that's caused our rapid cortical expansion and our

635
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,349
quick movement away from chimpanzees who aren't selective mater's by the way so

636
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:52,659
look at him Jesus you just want to slap him right he's a he's the son of a king

637
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:56,440
so he's very very privileged and he confuses his privilege with competence

638
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,159
rich of course all of you do because you're all sons of the King which is why

639
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,239
you can sit here in the university and you confuse your privilege with

640
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,679
competence as well because it's not has nothing to do with any of you that the

641
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,750
lights are on and that's the place is so peaceful

642
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,320
right but you take that for granted and it can make you false and arrogant like

643
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,300
like Jesus that's just so sad you look at that kid you think he's he's in for

644
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,230
real trouble man he thinks he knows everything and of course then he has a

645
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,929
wrestling match with what's-her-name what's it was it Nala yeah he has a

646
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:32,769
wrestling match with Nala and she just pins him every time right gotcha again

647
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:36,880
pindy again and that's basically right one of the things that happens with men

648
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,200
when they meet a woman who they really desire that Myers they project an idea

649
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,679
onto her immediately that's an anima projection and then that Adam a

650
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:48,250
projection judges them and they act all inferior and stupid and it's partly

651
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:53,349
because they are that's why and so then they they go down in defeat constantly

652
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:57,039
to this thing that they're projecting which at least has some concordance with

653
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,029
the actual woman but not that much so okay they keep wrestling and then

654
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,750
they're on the fringe of the kingdom this wrestling match between this pairs

655
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,530
of opposites takes them to the edge of the kingdom and they end up in the

656
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,000
elephant's graveyard right and and there's there's bones everywhere and so

657
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,360
now they're out into the kingdom of death and what that means is that these

658
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,460
two kids as they've grown up encounter death right they go outside the light

659
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,559
it's very very shocking for them they're very curious about it obviously they go

660
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,099
to explore the skeletons and all of that even though they were told not to but

661
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,630
their curiosity they can't stay away from death they're too curious about it

662
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,920
and so they developed knowledge of death and that and then of course out there in

663
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,460
the Deadlands is where the hyenas are and that's exactly right because hyenas

664
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,000
are scavengers right and they can break bones with their teeth they're really

665
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,530
really quite the animal and you know you kind of have a shudder of repugnance

666
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,040
when you see those things and I think it's partly I mean we shared

667
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,759
an evolutionary landscape with the ancestors of hyenas for a very very long

668
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,140
time and like vultures too you know you couldn't imagine something that would be

669
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:07,389
more well designed to look like it was a horrible thing than a vulture right and

670
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:11,529
there's this weird concordance and crows and ravens are like that - carrion

671
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,160
eaters you know the Eagles are kind of an exception but they look just as

672
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:19,389
creepy as they are which is really quite interesting and of course hyenas fall

673
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:23,769
into that category and they laugh - which is you know really you you also

674
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:27,489
have to laugh really with all these other things you have going for you and

675
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,719
anyways the hyenas and hyenas are enemies of lions and they can take lions

676
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:35,829
down they're tough things and you know they're not one high in obviously but a

677
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,590
bunch of hyenas can give a lie in a pretty damn rough time

678
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,900
and so and these little lines are really no match for the hyenas so they get

679
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,099
threatened very very rapidly and one of the hyenas of course is just completely

680
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,029
out of its mind and one of the things that's really interesting and you see

681
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,570
this with the Muppets - there was often a puppet that was like a crazy puppet

682
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,420
and its eyes would move in different directions you know and one of the

683
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,690
things that happens with people who are schizophrenic is they show involuntary

684
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,440
eye movements and it's because you have a brain center that controls your eyes

685
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,099
voluntarily and you have another one that controls them involuntarily so you

686
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:13,659
can see that look ahead and try to move your eyes smoothly back and forth you

687
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,500
can't do it you'll see that they jerk hey but if you watch put a finger in

688
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,280
front of your face and then do this they'll move perfectly smoothly and

689
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,120
that's because you're using different eye control centers one voluntary and

690
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,139
one more involuntary and the involuntary one is actually more sophisticated and

691
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:34,389
so in schizophrenic the involuntary eye control centers tend to disrupt the

692
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:39,549
voluntary eye control centers and that's likely part of the hallucinatory process

693
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,970
you know because you have the ego in this schizophrenic that's being

694
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:46,539
disrupted by processes underneath fantasies and that sort of thing and

695
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:49,630
that looks like it's reflected in involuntary eye movements like like

696
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,309
dream movements so anyways so much for the crazy hyena and they're in real

697
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:57,670
trouble now the Kings I who's supposed to be keeping an eye on this and was

698
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,630
supposed to be watching Simba is trying to intervene but I mean look at him he's

699
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,490
a like a delicious little bird and so that's not working out very well

700
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:11,679
anyways and then you see this immediate juxtaposition of the domain of death and

701
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,819
the hyenas with hell right and everyone looks at that and they think well they

702
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,390
know exactly what that means it's no surprise to anyone that that happens and

703
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:24,339
I suppose that's partly because on the veldt where we evolved in large part but

704
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,539
not by no means all part fire was an ever-present danger in the grasslands

705
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:37,769
right and so and so that's a good that's a good example of Hell so huh well I

706
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:47,519

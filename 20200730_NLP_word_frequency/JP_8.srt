1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,054
All right.

2
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:15,955
So...

3
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:19,295
We're going to leap out of the psycoanalytic

4
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,295
domain,

5
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:21,964
now.

6
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,685
and start talking about a form of

7
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,815
approach to personality and its transformations

8
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:31,745
that's predicated on

9
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:32,745
a different...

10
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,795
a set of different philosophical assumptions.

11
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:39,854
And...it's a bit tricky to navigate this because...

12
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,884
it requires the adoption of a different frame

13
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,164
of mind and, of course,

14
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:48,214
that's the case with all the theorists that we're going to be

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,215
discussing.

16
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:50,865
Uh...

17
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,685
Phenomenology probably had its most

18
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,054
thorough

19
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:01,325
explication

20
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,545
in the philosophy of

21
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:07,274
Martin Heidegger.

22
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:11,594
And Heidegger was actually trying to

23
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,505
reconstruct western philosophy

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,325
from the bottom up.

25
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:19,975
He tought that

26
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:23,834
we had been pursuing an improper

27
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,634
pathway  conceptually really ever since the time of the

28
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:27,954
Ancient Greeks.

29
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,875
Back around the turn of the century

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,099
-- the previous century, that's from the 19th

31
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,619
to the 20th century --

32
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,025
a new form of geometry was invented

33
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:47,085
and that geometry was predicated on different axioms

34
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:49,774
than Euclidian geometry. Now,

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,260
people had thought for thousand of years that

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,400
the world was properly described by Euclidian geometry.

37
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,405
and, you know,

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,480
when you employ a system like

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,160
Euclidian geometry you have...there's axioms that you have to

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,939
accept and they're like the rules of the game and, once you accept

41
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,299
the axioms then you can go ahead and play the game.

42
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:11,564
But there are other forms of geometry invented

43
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:14,764
and...in the...in the later part of the..

44
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,194
19th century and it turned out that  those

45
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:21,084
forms with different axioms actually described the world

46
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:24,444
better than the Euclidian forms, sort of like

47
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,055
the transformation from Newton

48
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:29,074
to Einstein...this was the..

49
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,015
transformation from Euclide to, say,

50
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,944
-- I think I"ve got his name right -- Rie...Riemannn, R, I, E, M,

51
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:38,064
A, N, N., who developed a new form of geometry and turned out to be

52
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:41,055
just the geometry that Einstein needed when he was putting his

53
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:44,185
theories forward. And, the reason I'm teling you that is because

54
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,139
you can think of systems that have different axioms as...

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,640
as different tools

56
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:53,775
Same idea that Piaget was trying to express

57
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,805
when he talked about how children's

58
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,685
cognitive representations underwent

59
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,905
stage transformations so that they were starting to apply

60
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,414
new principles. Not only a new way

61
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,644
of looking at the world but they were

62
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:12,340
fundamentally retooling their presumptions about how the world operated.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,465
And Heidegger tried to do the same

64
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,365
thing with philosophy. And so...

65
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:21,375
And it's tricky to figure out exactly what he was talking about

66
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,224
but I'll give it a shot and then, we can move

67
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,525
forward with Rogers

68
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,275
So...

69
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:30,564
Since the dawn of the scientific world and, likely, before

70
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,134
that, we have tended to believe

71
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:35,974
that we are subjects in a world of objects.

72
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,224
And that 's obvioulsy a

73
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:41,155
very useful way to view the world and you can

74
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,104
tell that because, formalizing that in the form of

75
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:47,004
science, has enabled us to extend

76
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,805
control over the world

77
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,185
in ways that we were not able to before.

78
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,344
Uh...To formulate the idea of

79
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:58,215
an objective truth has been an extraordinarily useful maneuver

80
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:01,085
and so, the idea, roughly, is that

81
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,415
everyone's perceptions can be contaminated by

82
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,694
their own biases and their own fantasies, that subjective

83
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:11,194
biases and fantasies and you can overcome that by

84
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,844
stringently specifying

85
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:16,334
the conditions under which an observation takes place

86
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,634
-- so that would be an experimental method --

87
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,939
Having multiple people  view the consequences

88
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,439
separately, have them detail out what the consequences are

89
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,139
and then look for commonalities across them. And, you think, well,

90
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,919
the commonalities across a set of observations

91
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,895
constitute a description of the objective world.

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,595
And that's been insanely powerful.

93
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,995
..uh....crazily powerful. I mean that's not all there is

94
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,704
to the scientific method but

95
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:43,784
it's a big part of it.

96
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,154
Now...

97
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,700
there is an emergent problem with that

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
perhaps,

99
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,359
It's complicated but one of the emergent problem

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,379
with that is...

101
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,319
maybe, a consequence of

102
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,399
stripping the subjectivity out of the world

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
So...

104
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,019
What science does is..consider

105
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,120
anything subjective as a form of bias or

106
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,019
error in the observation and then, get rid of it and so

107
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,079
what you're left with, when you...

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,740
formulate the scientific world, is a world that's stripped of

109
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:19,095
subjectivity. Now, the problem with that

110
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:21,325
is that you're a subject and so, when you strip

111
00:05:21,324 --> 00:05:24,235
the world of its subjectivity, that sort of leaves you

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,460
isolated, like an isolated being

113
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:30,354
with no necessary connections to

114
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,780
objective reality, in the midst of a set of

115
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,319
impersonal facts.

116
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,599
And, that seems to have psychological consequences

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,060
and the psychological consequences

118
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,000
are that, well, for example,

119
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:46,345
I think it's easier to develop a nihilistic sense

120
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,145
of being, for example, if you believe that the

121
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,875
world is nothing but objects and that you're,...

122
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,824
fundamentally, an object among many

123
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,324
and not a particularly important one, at that.

124
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,795
So...there are psychological

125
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,715
consequences to adopting the

126
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:07,244
scientific worldview.

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,759
Prior to the emergence of the

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,480
scientific worldview, people were more embedded in what

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,720
you might think about as a mythological landscape, you know, where

130
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:19,224
every element of being had its place in something that

131
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,605
approximated a master plan or, at least, a meaningful plan.

132
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:25,160
And so...the idea of ...

133
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,240
the meaningfulness of life was not necessarily

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
such a pressing intellectual concern.

135
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:35,925
And then...

136
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,120
well, and so, we don't know the full extent of that

137
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:40,064
...I mean...

138
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,160
I've talked to you a little bit about Nietzsche's

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,020
idea that's  expressed at the end of the 19th century about

140
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,099
the death of God and his prognostication that

141
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
the collapse of...

142
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,235
classic systems of meaning

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,860
open up people to posession by

144
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,080
nihilism and also by potentially totalitarian

145
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:02,194
political systems and that seems to have been what happened

146
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,964
Now, Heidegger was very concerned about that,

147
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:08,675
among other things. And so, he decided to

148
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:10,384
reconsider

149
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,324
reality from the bottom up.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,379
And so, what he did was generate an alternative set

151
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,300
of axioms. He said something like "what if we

152
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,745
decide

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,399
to make reality everything that we

154
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,699
experience? Forget about the subject/object divide.

155
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,914
And...One of the other problems with

156
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,314
the subject/object divide

157
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:34,795
for example, is accounting for consciousness, right? because

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
it's a problem that science really hasn't got any distance with

159
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,899
at all, as far as I can tell. I mean, people have been trying to crack

160
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,954
the secret of counsciousness, obviously, for a very long time

161
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,665
but they've been trying to do it formally

162
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,675
and using scientific methods, at least for the last

163
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,495
50 years and my sense of that is that they've

164
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:53,855
got absolutely nowhere.

165
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,279
Maybe, that's a bit unfair. We're better at

166
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,719
representing how conscious experiences

167
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,555
manifest themselves in the brain but we're

168
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,764
but we're certainly no better at understanding

169
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,284
how it is that we experience things. And that's the problem of

170
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,285
"qualia".

171
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,739
That's how the philosophers describe it. And qualia is

172
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,860
the quality of your experience, like the fact that pain,

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,215
for example...A pain you feel

174
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,134
is by no means identical, at least, as far as your concerned,

175
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,064
to some pattern of neurological activity, right?

176
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:28,064
It's pain. It seems to be a fundamental

177
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,779
reality of some... In fact, I think pain is THE fundamental

178
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,639
reality. I think it's the only thing that people will never

179
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,639
deny.

180
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,179
But...

181
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,485
So, there's these aspects of your

182
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,779
existence that are subjective, like your experience of

183
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,419
colour and your experience of beauty and just your experience

184
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,500
of things or, maybe, just your experience.

185
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,064
Your eperience plays an

186
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,995
indeterminate role

187
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:55,044
in the structure of being itself. 'Cause you might ask, well,

188
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,044
what would there be if there was nothing conscious?

189
00:08:58,174 --> 00:08:59,774
and you could say, well...

190
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,000
what would there be if there was nothing conscious of being?

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,879
Well, it's a tricky question, because

192
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,814
it depends on your a priori

193
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,435
axioms but...it's not obvious what

194
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,104
there would be in the absence of a conscious oberver.

195
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,899
There wouldn't obviously be any

196
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,720
duration between things. It would be very difficult to

197
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,980
specify things in terms of size. There wouldn't be

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,975
any of the qualities that we experience...

199
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,460
...that we experience our being is having 'cause

200
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,160
colour doesn't seem to be an intrinsic part of the world,

201
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,039
smell doesn't seem to be an intrinsic part of the world.

202
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,259
It's very difficult. The more you think about it, you'd find

203
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,375
the more difficut it is to determine exactly what there would

204
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,575
be if there was no one to observe it.

205
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,975
And...that's not the tree-in-the-forest idea, precisely

206
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:49,055
It's not so much if a tree falls in the forest

207
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,500
and there's no one to hear it, it doesn't make a sound

208
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,820
'cause that's more a matter of the definition of sound than anything else.

209
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,940
This is more, like, if there's a tree in the forest and there isn't anyone,

210
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,660
is there a tree ? And that's a

211
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,139
whole different question. Anyways, so, what Heidegger did,

212
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,779
partly because he was not pleased, I suppose,

213
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,799
with the metaphysical

214
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:13,384
consequences of the scientific worldview,

215
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,715
and also, perhaps, because he wasn't very

216
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:19,355
happy about our ability to account for consciousness,

217
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
he decided to see what would happen if he played

218
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,739
a different kind of game. And

219
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,019
you can do that in an intellectual discussion, you know, you can say, well,

220
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,139
here's a set of axioms out of which a system

221
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,220
will emerge, like, here's a set of rules out of which a game

222
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,300
would emerge. Same idea.

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,659
What if we start with a different set of rules? Let's see

224
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,059
what we can do if we do that. You kind of do that when you play one video game

225
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,419
rather than another. You know, there're little worlds

226
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,399
that pop out. There's a different underlining structure.

227
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,620
And then, you can go inside that world and experiment with it and

228
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,615
see what comes out of it.

229
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,924
So Heidegger decided to say "OK, what we're gonna do instead

230
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,764
is we're going to assume that everything we experience is real.

231
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:03,814
We're going to make our field of experience itself

232
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,665
reality".

233
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,754
And...So that would mean, from Heidegger's point of view,

234
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,134
that

235
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:12,695
everything about

236
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,714
the being that manifests itself to you is to be regarded as

237
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:20,535
equallly real. So, then, you think, well, that makes pain

238
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:23,865
a fundamental reality. That makes anxiety a fundamental reality.

239
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,560
It makes beauty and colour fundamental

240
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,179
realities. They're not self-evidently

241
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:32,680
reducible to anything else, which they would be...

242
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,085
...which they are in a scientific...from a scientific

243
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,545
perspective because you have to think about them as

244
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:41,259
manifestations of some more fundamental underlying

245
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,720
material reality. And I guess that's another problem with the

246
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,955
subject/object model and the material

247
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:48,965
model.

248
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:52,524
When you aggregate atoms, when you

249
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,584
arrange them in certain forms.

250
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,160
When they manifest themselves as certain molecules and then

251
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,379
in more complex structures, they seem to take on all sorts

252
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,654
of qualities that you couldn't predict if you just knew about

253
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:05,654
the

254
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:09,235
subatomic particles and the atoms themselves and so, of course, the...

255
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,115
those are called emerging properties and you say, well, you can

256
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,585
observe hydrogen and you can observe oxygen but

257
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,884
that doesn't make it self-evident

258
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:23,805
for you to be able to predict the properties of water. And, of course,

259
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:26,504
that's a more simpler problem, all things considered,

260
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:29,434
than the problem of figuring YOU out. You're this

261
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:32,634
crazily complex aggregate of these hypothetical...

262
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,235
hypothetically simple entities but

263
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,919
it isn't obvious how

264
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,579
their elemental properties can combine

265
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,440
to produce YOU. It's not obvious at all.

266
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,760
It's certainly not obious how a material that's supposed to be

267
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,740
dead matter, so to speak, can

268
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,615
manifest consciousness,

269
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,335
no matter how complexly it's arranged.

270
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:57,004
So...

271
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,595
The phenomenologists,

272
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:05,174
Heidegger leading them, were...

273
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,799
attempted to produce a philosophical model of

274
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,099
being.

275
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:12,365
And...We'll talk more specifically about the phenomenologists

276
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,455
after we're done with Rogers, but he is...

277
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:17,115
he fits in that

278
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:18,795
philosophical

279
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:20,515
framework.

280
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:22,615
And...

281
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:38,094
One of the things that I've thought...

282
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:41,654
-- This is a bit of a tangent but I'll move back

283
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,054
to the model afterwards. --

284
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,504
See, I really like the psychoanalysts.

285
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:49,054
And I like the idea that you have a psyche that's inside

286
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,304
of you and that is structured, in part

287
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,984
consciously and in part uncounsciously.

288
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:56,904
There's something about that that's really cool and I've learned a lot

289
00:13:57,225 --> 00:14:00,404
from the psychoanalysts. But, you know, there is a funny

290
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,044
conesquence of thinking the way they think -- and you do

291
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,495
think the way they think, even if you don't know it --

292
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,814
like we tend to think that a lot of us is inside our head,

293
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,925
you know. That's the psyche model basically.

294
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,105
But, the more I've practised as a clinical psychologist

295
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,435
the less I've actually been convinced that that's true

296
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:21,924
So, I could say, well...Let's say I want to know about

297
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:24,554
your personality. We think, well, I wanna now

298
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:27,454
you. I wanna know about your subjectivity and I want to know

299
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:29,004
what's inside of you.

300
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:32,175
But that is not exactly what you do want to know if you're doing clinical

301
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,544
work, say, with someone. You wanna know

302
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:37,245
do they have any friends?

303
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:40,435
That's really important. Because, if you're miserable

304
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,164
and anxious and badly placed in life

305
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:44,844
and misbehaving,

306
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,660
one of the reasons that all of that can occur is  'cause

307
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:50,980
you don't have any friends, you don't know anyone. And that's not something that's

308
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,320
inside you.

309
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:54,814
It's you, localized

310
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,899
in a broader sphere. And then, you might say, well, do you

311
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,220
have a job?

312
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,754
And...Well, let's talk about the job. Do you actually make enough

313
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,615
money with your job? Is it satisfying for

314
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:07,615
you in any way? Are you bullied all the time when you're at work?

315
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,394
Does it provoke anxiety? Is it a carrier that allows

316
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,444
you to go somewhere? Are you overworked?

317
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,820
Or...But let's start with just the first question.

318
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,400
Do you have a job? Well, if the answer to that is "no",

319
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,435
you have a serious problem and that would enough

320
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:25,154
might be to depress you and make you anxious and

321
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:28,134
hopeless and nihilistic and all of those things. And, you could say, well,

322
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,044
you're not reacting very well to not having a job but

323
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:34,125
that's kind of a foolish objection, even though some of

324
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,115
it might be true. One problem is that you're not reacting very

325
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:40,004
well to not having a job but another problem is that you don't have a

326
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:43,164
job and that, actually, constitutes the problem,

327
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:46,294
right? You don't get to eat, you don't have a place to live.

328
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,184
Those aren't psychological problems precisely, even

329
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:52,214
though a psychological probem could make it worse.

330
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:55,095
Well, are you as educated as you should be?

331
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,800
That's another question. How do you handle drugs and alcohol?

332
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,539
Are they taking you down a bad pathway? Know?

333
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:01,975
Uhmm...

334
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,799
What about intimate relationships ? Do you have one?

335
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,019
Do you have a plan for one? Or is that a never ending series of

336
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:11,074
catastrophes or something that you avoid completely?

337
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,865
That's a big problem! And, maybe, people don't...

338
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,914
aren't attracted to you for one reason or another and.... You can think about that as

339
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:19,584
a psychological problem but...it's an interpersonal

340
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:20,585
problem.

341
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,064
And the degree to which that's a psychological problem is...

342
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,740
is certainly unspecified when

343
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,480
you first begin to talk to somebody. What about your family? Do you have a family?

344
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:34,144
'Cause' it's hard to be in the world all by yourself. That's for sure!

345
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:37,225
It makes things a lot more stressful...even though having a family

346
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:40,105
can also be extraordinarily stressful...you know..

347
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:43,154
Do you have plans to have children? How are you doing with your parents?

348
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,579
Do you get along with your siblings? You know, all of

349
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,900
that, all of that, to me, is more

350
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:52,699
fundamental and it's outside of you. Those are elements of your experience.

351
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,815
More broadly...conceptualized...

352
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,580
more than they are objects of your psychology

353
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,160
or of your internal experience.  You know, it's sort of like

354
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:07,835
Well, a person is a creature that exists

355
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,944
at multiple levels of analysis.

356
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,759
Right? Something might go wrong with you at a

357
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,115
cellular level. So, maybe, you're born with a genetic abnormality.

358
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,704
So, something's wrong with you molecularly.

359
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,439
Or you have something wrong with a major organ.

360
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,259
Or, maybe, there's something wrong with you psycologically. Or, maybe,

361
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,920
you're in a pathological family. Or, maybe, you're stuck

362
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,375
in a pathological social system. And...

363
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,204
figuring out why you're suffering

364
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,599
means going up and down those different levels trying

365
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,679
to specify the appropriate level

366
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,744
for analysis and also the appropriate level for intervention.

367
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:43,714
And, for me, as I said, even though I'm a great admirer

368
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,754
of the psychoanalysts and I do

369
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,945
things like dream analysis which I really find

370
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,500
incredibly useful and enlightning, the first, the

371
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,194
fundamental level of analysis is, well, what's your experience structured like...

372
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:58,075
exactly? And that isn't localized in you.

373
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:00,805
Now, the behaviourists do that to, because...

374
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:03,755
-- which is one of the things I really like about the behaviourial approach of psychotherapy.

375
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,480
It's very very concrete and practical. It's like,

376
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,839
they'll say, well,

377
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,759
there're certain things that you need to have in order to live properly

378
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,879
and, maybe, you don't have the skills or the wherewithwall...

379
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,800
wherewithal to accumulate them and we'll break them down

380
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,079
into tiny little pieces and you'll practice. So, for example,

381
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:21,965
someone who doesn't have any friends and you do a micro-analysis

382
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:24,559
of their...social skills, say,

383
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,994
and maybe an analysis of the kind of anxiety

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,720
that are stopping them from going out and meeting people

385
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,940
and then you address those things practically one by one. You try

386
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,215
to get the person have some friends. You try to figure out how they can

387
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,924
establish an intimate relationship. You see if you could help

388
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,359
them sort out their family. You do what you can about their

389
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,714
employment and...A lot of that's only tangentially related

390
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:47,964
to -- really, in some sense -- to the structure of their psyche.

391
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:50,799
But, one of the things you'll see, if you work as a

392
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,914
clinician, or as a counsellor, is that, most of the time, people

393
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:56,825
come and see you because they have problems, not because they have psychological

394
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:57,894
problems.

395
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,899
And those things are not that easy to distinguish.

396
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,495
You know, it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea, sort of like, well, if you juste got

397
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:07,494
your act together, everything would work out for you. It's like,

398
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,545
yeaaaah...

399
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:12,974
There's some truth in that.

400
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:14,404
But...

401
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,700
But, you know if you're 55 years old and you've just been

402
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,259
laid off work,

403
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,519
and, maybe, through no fault of your own,

404
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,380
it isn't obvious how much getting your act together

405
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,100
is gonna help you find another job...because...

406
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,375
the actual problem that you're facing may have

407
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,335
relatively little to do with you. And that would especially be the case

408
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:38,335
if you're,

409
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,815
maybe, on the bottom half of the itelligence distribution,

410
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,625
for example, and so...it isn't

411
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,299
as easy for you just to go out and pick up new

412
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,259
skills at the drop of a hat...you know...and that

413
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,220
gets harder as you get older because your IQ actually declines quite

414
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,680
substantially as you get older, the working or the....

415
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,480
the fluid intelligence part, anyways -- exercise

416
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,559
can keep that at bay, by the way, it's the best way to keep that at bay.

417
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,384
So, anyways...you can think,

418
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:07,775
from the phenomenological viewpoint, of

419
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,465
your experience as a whole, instead of

420
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:12,439
you being a subject in an objective world.

421
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,019
And so...here's another way of...here's something that's quite useful.

422
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,455
Jung talked about this

423
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,100
'cause he was moving towards a phenomenological perspective later

424
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,875
in his life. The last book he wrote was called Mysterium Coniunctionis.

425
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,755
He talked about three conjunctions

426
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,615
that needed to take place in order for someone to be

427
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:32,605
well constituted psychologically. And, you know how

428
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,075
Piaget talked about

429
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:35,894
learning that you could,

430
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,224
not only follow rules, but that you could make rules for new

431
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:42,394
games as sort of a highest level of moral development. I would say

432
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:45,404
Jung extended the Piagetian

433
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,220
moral continuum

434
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,500
up past what Piaget had envisioned. Now, he didn't...

435
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:54,014
he didn't do that 'cause he wasn't trying to extend Piaget's model. But...

436
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,855
But you can think about it the same way. And it's not easy to

437
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:58,914
come up with a moral

438
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,980
mode of being, say, that transcends the ability to

439
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,214
make rules for new games. That's damn smart, man, that's...

440
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,115
That's a major home run by Piaget,

441
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,894
as far as I am concerned. But Jung said something like this.

442
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,280
He said, look, when you're going through the process of

443
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,039
psychological integration...

444
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:20,254
Here's a way of conceptualizing it. He thought about this as...

445
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,474
symbolically, as male-female pairings, because...

446
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:28,004
as I've tried to point out, the most... one of the most fundamental

447
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,935
categories that our mythological imagination

448
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:33,704
uses to structure the world is the category

449
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:36,814
of masculine and feminine. And it moves that around, you know,

450
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:39,825
it's a fundamental metaphor so you can move that around anywhere.

451
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,974
And so Jung thought well, one of the things that you're trying to do

452
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,619
is to get your thoughts and your emotions

453
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,000
integrated.

454
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,125
And so, you know, the classic Enlightenment viewpoint,

455
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,085
roughly speaking, is something like,

456
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:54,584
passion is the enemy of reason.

457
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,700
Right? And so, to the degree that you're rational, it's sort of

458
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,140
a Freudian viewpoint 'cause you've got your emotions under control.

459
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:04,704
And...there's some truth in that but...not enough truth.

460
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:07,595
I like the Piagetian idea better, which is that,

461
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,219
no, no, that isn't what happens. What happens is if...

462
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,414
if you're playing the proper game is that, you integrate your

463
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,625
emotions underneath your thinkings, something like that.

464
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:19,654
So, they're all working in the same direction, you know. So,

465
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,164
for example,

466
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:24,134
you can make your anxiety work against you or for you.

467
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,680
And, one of the ways...

468
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,920
I made a program, called the Future Authoring Program

469
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,960
that I think helps people do that. 'Cause, one of the things you see when you're

470
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,039
talking to people and they're trying to solve problems is that they're afraid to

471
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
face the problem.

472
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:39,915
And so, then, their anxiety is working against them and you can think about it as a...

473
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:43,264
as antagonistic to rationality.

474
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,754
But then, I could say, well, what if you think for a while about

475
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,140
what your life would be like if you didn't face

476
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,420
this problem?

477
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,279
Because, if you think that through, if you have a problem and you

478
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,720
really think through what the consequences are

479
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,279
gonna be in two to three years of not facing it, then

480
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,440
you're gonna get more afraid of not facing it than facing it.

481
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,255
And that's great because then, your anxiety, instead of

482
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,579
standing in front of you...instead of...

483
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,220
you having a dragon that's guarding the path in front of you, you

484
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,680
have one chasing you down the path from behind. That's

485
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,974
a lot more useful.

486
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:16,434
And so...

487
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:18,025
you know, that's just a...

488
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:21,705
a minimal example of the utility of getting your emotions

489
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:22,674
and your...

490
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,960
and your thoughts aligned the same way. The same

491
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,779
thing happens with the aggression.

492
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:30,044
You know...One of the most common reasons that people come and

493
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:33,215
seek psychotherapy, really, is because they're too agreeable.

494
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,860
But...what that means is they're not assertive enough. They haven't

495
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:39,679
integrated their capacity for aggression. And so, other people can push them around.

496
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:43,204
And...and they're very conflict avoidant.

497
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:46,164
And...and so, the consequences of that across time

498
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:49,474
is that you don't stand up for yourself well enough

499
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:52,355
and you get taken advantage of and that spirals

500
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:55,795
badly downwards. And so, partly what you do when you're

501
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,085
doing assertiveness training with people

502
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,075
is you find out what they're angry about...and...

503
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,699
They're usuallly angry, if they're not assertive enough,

504
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,799
because other people are taking advantage of them or, you could say, because they're not

505
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,159
putting their own...

506
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,980
necessities forward

507
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,339
with enough force. It's hard to distinguish between those two things.

508
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:15,835
But, anyways, you...

509
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,714
get them to talk about what they're angry about,

510
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:21,964
that often makes them cry, often many times,

511
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:24,720
and then, you get them to kind of envision what they would want

512
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,519
to have instead, which they're often afraid to do

513
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,019
because people are afraid to think about what they want

514
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,865
because that makes it more clear when they're not getting it

515
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:36,620
and that's painful, right?  Or, maybe, they're afraid of hoping

516
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:39,579
so they won't specify a clear aim. But, anyways, you get them to

517
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,835
think about what they might want instead. You get them

518
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,139
to think about the cost of not pursuing that

519
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,800
and then, you help them develop strategies for integrating

520
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,159
their aggression and... with their thinking,

521
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:54,774
so they can come up with a plan to

522
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,634
approach the world in a more confident way. So, for example,

523
00:24:57,634 --> 00:25:01,115
someone might come to me and say "I'm being bullied badly at work".

524
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:04,164
And so, then, I'll say "well, what are your options?

525
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,680
You have to put up with it? Well,

526
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,835
we'll figure that out cause maybe you do, maybe you don't have options.

527
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:12,904
But here's how to find out. Get your damn CV together,

528
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:16,055
so it's pristine, right? It's ready to go.

529
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:19,015
Get over your fear of a new interview, because

530
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:22,015
people are generally afraid of that. Get over your fear of applying

531
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:24,915
for a new job. Start thinking about what it would mean to have

532
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:28,154
a different job. Start thinking about what it would mean to have

533
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:31,004
a better job, even. Cause, maybe, your fear

534
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:33,665
is just making you stuck here but I can tell you one thing :

535
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,784
if someone's picking on you at work and you don't have options,

536
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,005
you lose."

537
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:41,664
So you get the person to start building a strategy. It's like, "OK,

538
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,615
if you're gonna tell this person to stop,

539
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,779
you have to know how to make them stop

540
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,899
and the one thing you need for sure is an option,

541
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,460
and, if you can't...if you don't have an option

542
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,535
then, maybe, we start thinking about the fact that you need some more

543
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:58,394
training or something like that. Because you cannot negotiate

544
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:00,045
if you don't have any power.

545
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,960
So...because while....especially if you're dealing with someone

546
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,079
who's really out to get you or really disagreeable,

547
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,919
If you don't have a leg to stand on, they'll just push you over and, maybe, they'll

548
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,315
jump on you too because that's what they're like and enjoy anyways, so...

549
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:13,315
It's no joke.

550
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:14,674
So...

551
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:17,305
You put your options behind you and then you

552
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:20,195
start to think about strategy." So I tell people "Look,

553
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:23,105
if you're being harassed at work, you document it every time

554
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:25,440
it happens. You write it down. So you've got like twenty

555
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,620
stories about it and it's fully documented. And then,

556
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,279
you go confront the person at some point with, at least,

557
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,879
3 pieces of evidence. And you have some

558
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,600
sense about what you tell them about what will happen if they don't stop.

559
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:40,615
So you have to figure out : well, they don't stop?

560
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,460
What are you gonna do about it? Leave? Not if you

561
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,815
can't leave. So, you have to be able to

562
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,775
-- what is it? -- wield a big stick and speak softly.

563
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,945
But, you see, that way...that's how you take your

564
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,375
aggression, which is an absolute necessary

565
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,525
part of your psyche and manifest it up into

566
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:01,585
a sophisticated means of dealing with the world.

567
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,605
You don't just suppress it and say "well, I should be able to put up with it"

568
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,745
or "I wish I wasn't so angry" or some...it's like...forget that!

569
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:09,345
That's...

570
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:12,279
All that'll happen is your blood pressure will stay high and you'll die of a heart

571
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,680
attack. Because anger, for example, is a very toxic emotion.

572
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,319
And it does cause heart damage over time. It's the only

573
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,220
emotion that we really know that's been linked to things like

574
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,019
cardiovascular risk. And anger is toxic because

575
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,884
it's like, you're driving a car, you're stepping on the gas

576
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:29,940
and pushing on the brake at the same time. Because

577
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,860
anger tells you to run away and to attack

578
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,444
...at the same time, cause you don't know what's gonna happen. And so, it

579
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:39,059
really amps up the physiological

580
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,294
demand on your body. And so, if you...

581
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,779
-- including your heart and your musculature -- so, if you stay like that for

582
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:47,819
like 10 years, you know...you're gonna age

583
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,299
20 years.

584
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:51,274
And that's a bad plan.

585
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:52,684
So...

586
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,720
So, you know, you take your

587
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,235
underground emotions and you integrate them into a sophisticated

588
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,375
reality.

589
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,095
Now...

590
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:04,805
Jung said, so

591
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:08,355
"FIrst of all you unite your mind,

592
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,099
your thinking, let's say, with your emotions. So that makes one

593
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,179
thing, instead of two fighting things."

594
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:17,424
OK. That's a good one. And then, the next conjunction

595
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:18,740
he talked about was

596
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,795
"It isn'tenough to unite your mind

597
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,200
and your emotions". And he tought about that as male/female

598
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,120
pairing, symbolically. That's how

599
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,079
it would manifest itself sometimes in dreams. So you

600
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:32,134
take the masculine element and the feminine element,

601
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:35,144
the thinking and the emotion, unite

602
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,839
those and that makes you more like one thing. OK and now,

603
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,059
all of a sudden, that's represented as symbolicaly male, that one thing.

604
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,099
And it unites with something else that's now represented

605
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,519
symbolically femin...female. That's the body.

606
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,664
So you take the mind/emotion integration

607
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:52,359
and integrate that in your body. So what'd that be?

608
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,719
You act it out!

609
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,819
Instead of just thinking.

610
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,659
So, there's this philosophical idea called a...

611
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,180
-- now I'm gonna forget what it's called -- It's a

612
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,440
contradiction in action! There's actually a technical term for it.

613
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,845
But that's when you think and believe something but you don't act it out.

614
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:12,595
And so, that means there's a dissociation  in you somehow

615
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:15,884
between your abstract representations and

616
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,914
what you manifest in action. Wel that's

617
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:22,214
another form of discontinuity that isn't doing you any good.

618
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,980
You know, the driver is going one way and the car is going the

619
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,720
other. And you won't even be able to understand yourself, if you do that.

620
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,754
But, even more, you're not putting your principles into practice.

621
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:35,175
So, you're dissociated. Your being is dissociated. So...

622
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:38,174
Once you get your mind and your emotions working together, then

623
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,740
the next thing to do is to act that out consistenly.

624
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,375
That was the second conjunction, as far as Jung was concerned, and then

625
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,884
the third one was -- this is the tough one, and

626
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,994
this is the one that's related to phenomenology --

627
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:53,345
you erase the distinction between yourself and the world.

628
00:29:54,244 --> 00:29:55,244
OK.

629
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:56,725
That's a tough one.

630
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:59,344
So, imagine you're dealing with someone who's hoarding.

631
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:02,915
Now, people who are hoarding are often older or

632
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:06,254
neurologically damaged or they have obsessive compulsive disorder.

633
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,579
But then, you walk into their house and there's like ten

634
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,779
thousands things in their house. There's...there's...there's

635
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:15,359
There's, maybe, a hundred boxes. And you open up a box and, in the box, there's some

636
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:18,035
pens and some old passports and some

637
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:21,025
checks and... there's collections of silver dollars and

638
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:23,884
some hypodermic needles and some dust and...

639
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:26,815
you know, a dead mouse and...and...

640
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,404
there's boxes and boxes and boxes. It's like

641
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:32,164
that in the house. It's absolute chaos in there.

642
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,839
Absolute chaos. Not order...chaos.

643
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,899
And then, you think, is that their house or is that

644
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,455
their being? Is that their mind? And the answer is :

645
00:30:40,454 --> 00:30:43,424
there's no difference. There's no difference.

646
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,004
So, you know, I could say, well, if you want to organize your

647
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:49,015
psyche, you could start by organizing your room...if that

648
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,859
would be easier, cause, maybe, you're a more

649
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:53,139
concrete person and you need something concrete to do.

650
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,880
So...you go clean up under your bed and you

651
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,275
make your bed and you organize the papers on your desk and you think, well...

652
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,680
Just exactly what are you organizing? Are you

653
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,220
organizing the objective world or are you objecting your field...

654
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:07,704
are you organizing your field of being,

655
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:10,125
like your field of total experience?

656
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,500
And Jung believed that...and I think

657
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,759
there's a Buddhist doctrine that's sort of nested in there,

658
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,319
that, at the highest level of psychological integrration, there's

659
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:20,975
no difference between you and what your experience.

660
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,559
Now, you think, well,

661
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,819
I can't control everything I experience. But that's no objection

662
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,694
because you can't control yourself anyway, so the mere fact

663
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:32,764
that you can't extend control over everything

664
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,660
you experience is no argument against the

665
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,060
idea that you should still treat that as an extension of yourself.

666
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,095
Well, let's say that you have a longstanding

667
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:44,144
feud with your brother. Well...

668
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:47,134
Is that a psychological problem? Is that him?  Is it a

669
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:50,115
problem in the objective world or is it a problem in your field

670
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:53,184
of being? And it's very useful to think

671
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,559
that way because you might ask what could you do to

672
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,619
improve yourself? Well, let's step

673
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:01,899
one step backwards. The first question might be why should you even bother

674
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:03,375
improving yourself?

675
00:32:03,904 --> 00:32:06,454
And I think the answer to that is something like : so you don't

676
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:09,664
suffer any more stupidly than you have to.

677
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:12,744
And, maybe, so others don't have to either. It's something like that.

678
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:15,944
You know, like, there's a real injunction at the bottom of it. It's not some

679
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:19,164
casual self-help doctrine, it's that if you don't

680
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,779
organize yourself properly, you'll pay for

681
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,680
it. And in a big way. And so will the people around you. Now...

682
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:28,715
And, you could say, well, I don't care about that but that's actually not

683
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,674
true. You actually do care about that. Because, if you're in pain,

684
00:32:31,674 --> 00:32:34,565
you will care about it. And so, you do care

685
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:37,545
about it. Even if it's just that negative way, you know.

686
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:40,125
It's very rare that you can find someone

687
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,565
who's in excruciating pain who would ever say

688
00:32:43,204 --> 00:32:46,214
well, it would be no better if I was out of this.

689
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,234
This sort of pain is one of those things that brings

690
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,444
the idea that it would be better if it didn't exist

691
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:54,625
along with it. It's incontrovertible.

692
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,840
So...You get your act together so that there

693
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,994
isn't any more stupid pain around you than necessary.

694
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,480
So then, the question might be: well, how would you go about getting

695
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,660
your act together? And the answer to that

696
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,800
-- and this is a phenomenological idea too -- it's something like:

697
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:11,845
look around for something that bothers you

698
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:13,335
and see if you can fix it.

699
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,944
So...Now, you think, well

700
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,394
let's say you go into a

701
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,099
-- you can do this in a room. It's quite fun to do it just when

702
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:25,179
you're sitting in a room, like, a room...maybe, your bedroom, you can sit there

703
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,580
and then just sort of meditate on it, think, OK, if I wanted to

704
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:31,724
spend 10 minutes making this room better,

705
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:34,835
what would I have to do? And you have to ask yourself that,

706
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:37,855
right? It's not a command, it's like a genuine question. And things

707
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,519
will pop out in the room that, you know, you...like...there's a

708
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,875
stack of papers over there that's kind of bugging you and you know that, maybe,

709
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,994
a little order there would be a good thing and, you know you haven't...

710
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:50,244
There's some rubbish behind your computer monitor that you haven't

711
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:53,474
attended to for, like, six months and...the room would be slightly better

712
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,079
if it was a little less dusty and the cables weren't all

713
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,359
tangled up the same way and...

714
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,734
like, if you...if you allow

715
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:02,714
yourself just to consider the

716
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:05,724
expanse in which you exist at that moment,

717
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:08,339
there'll be all sorts of things that will pop out in it, that

718
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,880
you could just fix.

719
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,394
And, you know, I might say, well, if you're coming to see me for

720
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:16,335
psychotherapy, the easiest thing for us to do

721
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,920
first would just be to get you to organize your room.

722
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,800
You think, well, is that psychotherapy? And the answer is, well,

723
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,060
it depends on how you conceive the limits of your

724
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,065
being

725
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:30,034
And, I would say, start where you can start.

726
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,920
You know, if something announces itself

727
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,539
to you, which is a strange way of thinking about it,

728
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,820
as in need of repair, that you could repair,

729
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:42,025
then, hey! fix it! You fix a hundred

730
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:45,485
things like that, your life will be a lot different.

731
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,719
You know, I often tell people too, "fix the things you

732
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,234
repeat every day. Cause people tend to think of those as trivial.

733
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:55,015
Right? You get up, you brush your teeth,

734
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,460
you have your breakfast, you know, you have your

735
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,434
routines that you go through everyday. Well, those...those probably

736
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,380
constitute 50% of your life. And

737
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,360
people think "well, they're mundane, I don't need to pay attention to them", it's like

738
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:09,034
no, no, that's exactly wrong. The things you do every day,

739
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,625
those are the most important things you do.

740
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:15,045
Hands down. All you have to do is do the arithmetic.

741
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:17,045
You figure it out right away.  So...

742
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:20,435
A hundred adjustments to your...broader

743
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:23,344
domain of being and there's a lot less

744
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,464
rubbish and..

745
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:28,085
there's a lot less rubbish around and a lot fewer traps for you

746
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,295
to step into. And so...

747
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,585
That's in keeping with Jung's idea about

748
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,519
erasing the diss...once you've got your mind and your

749
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,840
emotions together and once you're acting that out, then

750
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:42,714
you can extend what you're willing to

751
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,199
consider yourself and start fixing up the things

752
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,174
that are part of your broader extent. Now,

753
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,045
sometimes, you don't know how to do that. So, you might say, imagine you're walking down

754
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:55,065
Bloor Street and there's this guy who's, like, alcoholic

755
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,764
and schizophrenic and he's been on the street for ten years.

756
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:00,835
He sort of stumbles towards you and, you know, incoherently

757
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:03,235
mutters something. That's a problem!

758
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,380
And...it would be good if you could fix it but

759
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,519
you haven't got a clue about how to fix THAT.

760
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,359
You just walk around that and go find something that you could

761
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:15,034
fix because, if you muck about in that,

762
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,340
not only is it unlikely that' you'll help that person, it's very

763
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,420
likely that you'll get hurt yourself. So...

764
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:23,445
you know, just because, while your experiencing

765
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,535
things announce themselves as in need of repair

766
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:29,524
doesn't mean that it's you, right then and there, that

767
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:32,664
should repair them. You have to have some humility, you know.

768
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:35,715
You don't walk up to a helicopter that isn't working and just start

769
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,135
tinkering away with it. You have to stay within

770
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:41,275
your domain of competence. But, most of the time, when people look

771
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,315
at their lives, you know....

772
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:46,954
-- It's a very interesting thing to do. I like...I like

773
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,144
the idea of the room because you can do that at the drop of a hat.

774
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:53,114
You know, go back to where you live and sit down and think "OK,

775
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:56,584
I'm gonna make this place better for half an hour. What should I

776
00:36:56,585 --> 00:36:57,519
do?"

777
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,259
You have to ask.

778
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:02,634
And...things will just pop up like mad. And it's partly

779
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:05,685
because your mind is a very strange thing. As soon as you give it an aim,

780
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,400
a genuine aim, it'll

781
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,300
reconfigure the world in keeping with that aim. That's, that's

782
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,160
actually how you see, to begin with. And so, if you

783
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,039
set it a task, espec... -- you have to be genuine about it,

784
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,880
which is why you have to bring your

785
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:22,174
thoughts and emotions together and then, you have to get them in

786
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:24,875
your body, so you're acting consistently. You have to

787
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,684
be genuine about the aim - But once you aim, the

788
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:30,554
world will reconfigure itself around that aim,

789
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:33,634
which is very strange. And...and... it's...

790
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:36,435
it's..it's technically true.

791
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,235
You know, the best example of that

792
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:42,095
-- you've all seen this video where you...watch the

793
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,744
basket ball being tossed back and forth

794
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:47,505
between members of the white team versus the black

795
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,880
team and, while you're doing that, a gorilla

796
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,880
walks up into the middle of the video and you don't see it. It's like...

797
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:55,885
-- you know, if you thought about that experiment for about five

798
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:58,925
years, that would be about the right amount of time to spend thinking about it.

799
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:01,945
Because, what it shows yo isthat you see what you aim at.

800
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,980
And that, man, if you can get one thing through your

801
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,974
head as a consequence of even being in University,

802
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:10,644
that would be a good one: you see what you aim at.

803
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,545
And so, because...one...

804
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,620
inference you might draw from that is... be careful what

805
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:17,940
you aimt at!

806
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:21,065
Right? What you aim at determines the

807
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,065
way the world manifests itself to you. And so, if the world is

808
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,860
manifesting itself in a...

809
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,034
very negative way, one thing to ask

810
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:31,664
is: are you aiming at the right thing? Now...

811
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:34,644
you know, I'm not trying to reduce everybody's problems to

812
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:37,885
an improper aim. People get cut off at the knees for all

813
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:41,005
sorts of reasons, you know. They get sick, they have accidents,

814
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:44,244
There's a random element to being, that's for sure. But

815
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:47,174
-- and so, you don't want to take anything, even that particular

816
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:50,175
phrase too far. You want to bind it with the fact that

817
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,424
random things do happen to people. But it's still a great thing to

818
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:56,120
ask.-- OK, so, Rogers was a

819
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,394
phenomenologist. He was interested in...he didn't start

820
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:02,614
his philosophy from the perspective of

821
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:05,644
subject versus object or from the idea of psyche,

822
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,644
like, sort of inside you, your mind

823
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:09,844
with it's layers.

824
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:12,704
That's not how it looked at it. And so,

825
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:14,344
let's go through...

826
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:18,355
(now...) I'll introduce you to Rogers. I think that...

827
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:21,344
then we'll talk more about him next time. I'm gonna start though,

828
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,294
with something that I learned from him that  I think was of

829
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,019
crucial importance. And so, we'll set the stage for the

830
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:30,960
further discussion with this. And I'm gonna read it to you.

831
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:34,554
ROGERS : "Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in

832
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,444
contact and to receive communications, we may say that

833
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:40,115
the greater the communicated congruence

834
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:41,424
of experience,

835
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,015
awareness and behaviour on the part of

836
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:48,045
one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will involve

837
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:50,985
a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same

838
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,335
qualities. Mutually accurate

839
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:56,534
understanding of the communications, improved psychological adjustments

840
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:58,894
and functioning in both parties, and mutual

841
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,394
satisfaction in the relationship."

842
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,159
It's quite a mouthful.

843
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,059
What does it mean?

844
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:07,340
"Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact

845
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,740
and to receive communications." Okay, we are having a conversation.

846
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,500
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.

847
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,539
Right,

848
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,039
That's different than how people

849
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:16,940
generally

850
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:20,039
communicate, because usually when they communicate,

851
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,994
they're doing something like: Okay

852
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:26,065
We're going to have a conversation, and I'm going to tell you why I'm right,

853
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:27,755
and I'll win if you agree

854
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,785
or maybe you're having a conversation where

855
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:33,614
i don't know what your trying to do, maybe your trying to impress the person

856
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,674
you're talking to, so you're not listening to them at all, you're just thinking about  what you're

857
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:39,965
going to say next. Okay, so that's Not This.

858
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,785
This Is: You might have something to tell me.

859
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:46,335
And So, I'm going to Listen On the off chance

860
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:49,385
that you'll tell me something that would really  be useful for me to know.

861
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,925
and so, you can think about it as an

862
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,885
extension of the Piagetian...

863
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,420
you know Piaget talked about the fundamental

864
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,560
The fundamentally  important element of knowledge being

865
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,679
to describe how knowledge is sought.

866
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:05,379
The process by which knowledge is generated. Well,

867
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,659
if you agree with me and I find that out,

868
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:12,014
I know nothing more than I knew before. I just know what I knew before.

869
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,375
And, maybe, I'm happy about that because, you know, it didn't get

870
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,594
challenged. But I'm no smarter than I was before.

871
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:18,855
But, maybe, you're different than

872
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:21,945
me and so, while I'm  listening to you, you'll tell me something I would...

873
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:24,700
I don't like. Maybe, it's something I find contemptible...

874
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:28,034
or difficult, whatever. Maybe you'll find...you'll tell me something

875
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,079
I don't know. And then, I won't be quite as stupid. And then,

876
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,860
maybe,  I won't run painfully into quite as many things.

877
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:37,734
And that's a really useful thing to know, especially if you live

878
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:40,239
with someone and you're trying to make long-term

879
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,599
peace with them and they're not the same as you.

880
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:46,105
And their way they look at the world and the facts that they pull out of the world

881
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:48,425
aren't the same as your facts. And...

882
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,279
even though you're going to be overwhelmed with the

883
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,160
procilvity to demonstrate that you're right,

884
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:56,799
it is the case that two brains are better than one.

885
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,005
And so, maybe, nine of the ten

886
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:02,454
things they tell you are dispensable,

887
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,039
or, maybe, even 49 out of 50. But

888
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,195
one thing...all you need to get out of the damn conversations is

889
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,144
one thing you don't know. And one of the things that's very

890
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:13,914
cool about a good psychotherapeutic

891
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:17,014
session is that the whole conversation is like that.

892
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:19,525
All you're doing is trying to...

893
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:23,235
express the truth of the situation

894
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:26,565
as clearly as possible. That's it!

895
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:28,094
And so...

896
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,015
Now, Rodgers' proposition

897
00:42:32,454 --> 00:42:35,614
-- and I'll tell you why he derived it -- was that,

898
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:38,384
if you have a conversation like that with someone,

899
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:40,955
it will make both of you better.

900
00:42:40,954 --> 00:42:43,715
It will make both of you psychologically healthier.

901
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:46,855
So, there's an implicit presupposition that the exchange

902
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,885
of truth is curative. Well, that's

903
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:52,845
a very cool idea. I mean, it's a very deep idea.

904
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:55,704
I think it's the most profound idea...

905
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:58,565
It's the idea upon western civil...

906
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:01,215
upon which western civilization -- although not

907
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:04,135
only western civilization -- is actually predicated.

908
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:07,075
The idea that truth produces health. But for

909
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:10,234
Rogers, that was the entire purpose of the psychotherapeutic alliance.

910
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:13,315
You  come to see me because you want to be better.

911
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,114
You don't even know what that means, necessarily. Neither do I.

912
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:20,184
We're gonna figure that out together. But you come and you say

913
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:23,195
"Look, things are not acceptable to me and

914
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,379
maybe, there's something I could do about that". So

915
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,460
that's the minimal precondition to engage in therapy.

916
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:31,575
Something's wrong. You're willing to talk about it truthfuly

917
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:34,904
and you want it to be better. WIthout that, the therapeutic

918
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:37,754
relationship does not get off the ground.

919
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:40,815
And so, then, you might ask: well what relationships are therapeutic?

920
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,934
And the answer to that will be: if you have a real relationship,

921
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,320
it's therapeutic.

922
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,519
If it isn't, what you have is not a relationship. God only

923
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,545
knows what you have. You're a slave, they're a tyrant.

924
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,505
You know, you're both butting heads with one another. It's a primate

925
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:57,505
dominance hierarchy dispute or,

926
00:43:57,505 --> 00:44:00,525
I don't know, you're like two cats in a barrel or two people with their hands around

927
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:03,204
each other's throats. But what you have is not a

928
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:05,264
relationship. So...

929
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:08,365
All right. ROGERS "We may say that the greater the

930
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:11,264
communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behaviour on the

931
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:14,364
part of one individual"...PETERSON That's a reference to the same idea

932
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:17,394
that I was describing, with regards to Jung. so...

933
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:18,394
Let's say,

934
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:21,884
you come and talk to me and you want things do go well. Well, I'm gonna

935
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:24,800
have to more or less be one thing. Because,   if I'm all over the

936
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,155
place,

937
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,759
you can't trust any continuity in what I

938
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,980
say. There's no....and...you

939
00:44:30,985 --> 00:44:33,295
There's no reason for you to believe that I'm capable

940
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,695
of actually telling you...

941
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,945
...I'm capable of expressing anything that's true.

942
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:40,914
So, the truth is something that emerges as a consequence

943
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:44,164
of getting yourself lined up...and beating all the...

944
00:44:45,485 --> 00:44:46,664
-- what would you call? --

945
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:51,154
...all the impurities out of your...out of your...

946
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:52,454
out of your....

947
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:55,445
soul, for lack of a better word.

948
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:58,655
You have to be integrated for that to happen. And you do that, at least in

949
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,065
part, by wanting to tell the truth. ROGERS "...the more the ensuing

950
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,715
relationship wil involve a tendency towards

951
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,954
reciprocal communication with the same qualities...." PETERSON : So, one of

952
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,894
the things -- 'cause I've been quite influenced by Rogers --

953
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:13,804
One of the things I try to do in my therapeutic sessions is,  first of all,

954
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:16,704
to listen, to really listen. And then,

955
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:19,284
while I listen, I watch. And while

956
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,894
I'm listening, things will happen in my head.

957
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:25,165
You know, maybe, I'll get a litte image of something or

958
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,900
I'll get a thought or a question will emerge and I'll just tell the

959
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,860
person what that is. But it's sort of

960
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,460
directionless, you know. It's not like I have a goal

961
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,300
-- except that we're trying to make things better -- I'm on the side

962
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,920
of the person...I'm on the side of the part of the

963
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:41,175
person that wants things to be better, not worse.

964
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,405
And so, then, those parts of us have a dialogue and

965
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:47,405
the consequence of that dialogue is that certain things take place.

966
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:50,315
And then, I'll just tell the person what happened. And it isn't that

967
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,434
I'm right.

968
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:54,894
That's not the point The point of this is that, they get to have an hour

969
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:57,954
with someone who actually tells them what they think.

970
00:45:58,184 --> 00:46:00,045
Here's the impact you're having on me.

971
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:03,335
You know...This is making me angry. This is making me

972
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,200
happy. This is really interesting. This

973
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,899
reminds me of something that you said an hour ago that I  don't quite understand.

974
00:46:09,284 --> 00:46:10,284
And the whole...

975
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,245
the whole point is not, for either

976
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:16,204
person to make the propositon or convince

977
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:19,394
the other that their position is correct, but merely to

978
00:46:19,394 --> 00:46:22,184
have an exchange of experience

979
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:24,719
about how things are set up.

980
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,940
And it's extraordinarily useful for people because it's often difficult

981
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,460
for anyone to find anyone to talk to that will actually listen.

982
00:46:31,824 --> 00:46:34,904
And so...another thing that's really strange about this listening

983
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:38,015
is that, if you really listen to people, they will tell you the weirdest bloody things

984
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:40,599
so fast you just cannot believe it. So,

985
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,954
if you're having a conversation with someone and it's dull, it's because

986
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:46,944
you're stupid. That's why. You're not

987
00:46:46,945 --> 00:46:49,914
listening to them properly. Because they're weird. They're like

988
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:53,585
wombats or albatrosses or rhinoceroses or something,

989
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,605
like, they're strange creatures. And so if you were actually

990
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,815
communicating with them and they were telling you how weird they really are,

991
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:02,865
it would be...it would be anything but boring.

992
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:06,264
So.... And you can ask questions, that's a really good

993
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,085
way of listening. But, you know... one of

994
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:12,375
Rogers' point is that, well,  you have to orientate properly in order to listen.

995
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,954
And the orientation has to be:

996
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:16,324
look, what I want out of this conversation is

997
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:19,244
that the place we both end up is better than the place we left.

998
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,215
That's it!

999
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:23,315
That's what I'm after. And, if you're not after that, you gotta think:

1000
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:26,325
why the hell wouldn't you be after that? What could you

1001
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:29,274
possibly be after that would be better than that?

1002
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:32,264
You walk away smarter and more well equipped for

1003
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:35,464
the world than you were before you had the conversation.

1004
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:38,280
And so does the other person. Well, maybe, if you're

1005
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,535
bitter and resentful and angry and anxious and, you know,

1006
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:44,204
generally annoyed at the world, then,

1007
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:47,074
that isn't what you want. You want the other person  to walk away

1008
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:50,424
worse, and you too, cause you're full of revenge. But...you know...

1009
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:54,245
You'll get what you want, if you do that. So...

1010
00:47:54,974 --> 00:47:57,934
ROGERS "We know from our research that such empathic

1011
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:00,884
understanding..." PETERSON: It's already defined, that. I want to hear you,

1012
00:48:00,885 --> 00:48:04,325
I want to hear what you have to say, so we can clarify it and move forward.

1013
00:48:04,474 --> 00:48:07,844
I want to have your best interest in mind...And mine as well...but...

1014
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:10,905
you know...both at the same time. Your family's too, if we

1015
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:14,105
can manage that. We're after making things better.

1016
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:17,625
ROGERS: "We know from our reserach that such emphatic understanding

1017
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,394
-- understanding with a person, not about them -- is such an

1018
00:48:20,394 --> 00:48:23,215
effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality.

1019
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:26,184
Some of you may be feeling that you listen well

1020
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:29,125
to people and that you have never seen such results. The chances are

1021
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,594
very great that you have not been listening

1022
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:34,375
in the manner that I have described. Fortunately, I can suggest

1023
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:37,315
a little experiment that you can do to test the quality of our understanding.

1024
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,655
the quality of our understanding. The next time you get into an argument

1025
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:43,335
with your wife, or your friend, or a small group of friends, stop

1026
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:46,244
the discussion for a moment and, for an experiment, institute

1027
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,284
this rule.

1028
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:50,894
Each person can speak up for himself only

1029
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,155
after he has first restated the ideas and feelings

1030
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:56,565
of the previous speaker accurately."

1031
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:58,545
PETERSON: What "accurately" means is they have to

1032
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:01,644
agree with your restatement. Now, that's an annoying

1033
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:04,420
thing to do! Because, if someone is talking to you and you

1034
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,180
disagree with them, the first thing you wanna do is take their argument and make it

1035
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:10,239
the stupidest possible thing out of it that you can

1036
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,959
-- that's the straw man -- and then, demolish it.

1037
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:16,244
It's like...so then, you can walk away feeling good about it

1038
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,539
and, you know, you primate domins...

1039
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,139
dominated them really nicely. So...

1040
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:24,379
But that is not what you do. You say, OK, well, I'm gonna take what you told me,

1041
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:27,665
and, maybe, I'm even gonna make your argument stronger than the one you made.

1042
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,764
That's useful if you're dealing with someone that you have to live with.

1043
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:33,299
Because, maybe, they can't bloody well express themselves very well but they

1044
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,220
have something to say. So you...make

1045
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,204
their argument strong. All right...then...

1046
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:42,295
ROGERS: "You see what this would mean. It would mean that before presenting

1047
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:44,204
your own point of view, it'd be necessary

1048
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:47,554
for you to really achieve the other speaker's frame of reference

1049
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:50,094
-- to understand his thoughts and feelings so well

1050
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:53,164
that you could summarize them for him. Sound simple

1051
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,164
doesn't it?

1052
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,355
But if you try it, you'll find that it's the most

1053
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:59,375
difficult thing that you've ever done."

1054
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:02,835
PETERSON: OK, good, we'll leave it at that and then, we'll see you on Tuesday.

2
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:23,219
well you might as well start by writing down that URL I'll show it to you again

3
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,099
at the end of class that's where the syllabus is the syllabus will tell you

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:38,640
pretty much everything you need to know about the class the there's a text this

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,960
is it it consists of readings from a larger text I use it because it's old

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,338
but a lot of the theorists that we're going to talk about are also old and so

7
00:00:53,338 --> 00:01:00,780
I found this particular text accurate and many of the people that we're going

8
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:10,079
to talk about are very a very sophisticated views of personality and I

9
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,159
think that it does you a disservice unless you read something that's

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,329
sufficiently sophisticated so that you actually understand at least to some

11
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:30,030
degree what the people that were going to study we're talking about we might as

12
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,599
well start I suppose with a definition of personality it's hard to define

13
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,408
something that's that general because when you're speaking about human beings

14
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,120
it's not that simple to figure out what constitutes personality and what

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,890
constitutes something else but so I'm going to hit at it from a couple of

16
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,280
different perspectives and while I'm doing so I would like you also to

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:11,549
consider the nature of what you're going to learn a human personality is

18
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:17,340
essentially unfathomable human beings are unbelievably complicated and and

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,930
we're nested in systems that are also unbelievably complicated there are more

20
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,469
patterns of connections between neurons in your

21
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,359
brain then there are subatomic particles in the universe by a substantial margin

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,450
you can look up Gerald Adelman if you want to find out about that and so it's

23
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,969
not unreasonable to point out that you're the most complicated thing we

24
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:49,469
know of by many orders of magnitude and the probability that you can understand

25
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:57,810
yourself in anything approaching totality is extraordinarily low so this

26
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:08,689
makes the study of personality something very daring and hopeless and complicated

27
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,949
now we're going to cycle through a very large number of theorists and what

28
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,909
you'll find is that although there are commonalities between them there are

29
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:26,430
market differences and so then you might ask yourself well what's the point of

30
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,030
studying this sequence of theorists and ideas if there's no point of agreement

31
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,050
between them and I would say first there are points of agreement between them

32
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,120
although personality hasn't advanced to the point where I would say that we have

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,840
a homogeneous theory that's free of internal contradictions but I would also

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:03,299
say that personality is a hybrid discipline it's partly science but it's

35
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,120
partly engineering the clinical element of it I would say is more like

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,349
engineering and what engineers do is try to do things they try to make something

37
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,689
happen and they are informed by theory but the point is still to build

38
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,850
something and when you're working as a clinical psychologist and most of the

39
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,110
initial fears that we'll discuss for the first little more than a third to a half

40
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,740
of the course or clinical theorists they're trying to build something and

41
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,300
they're dealing with very very difficult conceptual problems

42
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,418
because they're either trying to cure mental disorders or maybe even

43
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:52,459
unhappiness and trying to bring about health and the problem with that is that

44
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,568
it's not a straightforward thing to define a mental disorder from a

45
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:03,990
scientific perspective because what's healthy mentally and what's not is

46
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,490
partly social judgment and it's partly socially constructed and it partly has

47
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,069
to do with norms and it partly has to do with ideals because you might also say

48
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:22,800
that to be healthy is to be normal but you could also say that to be healthy is

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,389
to be ideal and then of course you run into the problem of having to

50
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:36,000
conceptualize an ideal and it isn't self-evident that science is capable of

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,370
conceptualizing an ideal because ideals tend to fall into the domain of moral

52
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,478
judgments say or philosophical judgments rather than scientific judgments per se

53
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:58,288
so what I would say to you is that it would be worthwhile to approach this

54
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:05,158
course as if you were an engineer of the human spirit an engineer of your own

55
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:12,139
spirit to begin with but also an engineer of the spirits of other people

56
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:18,210
because as you interact with other people you inevitably tell them what you

57
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:25,680
want and what you don't want when they give you what you want and what you

58
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,360
admire you respond positively to them you pay attention to them you smile at

59
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,240
them you focus you focus your thoughts on them you interact with them and you

60
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,000
reward them for acting in a particular manner and when they don't respond the

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,389
way that you want then you punish them with a look or by turning away or by

62
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,019
rejecting their friendship or when you're a child by refusing to play for

63
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,629
them play with them and so we're engaged in the co-creation

64
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:06,860
of personalities our own and others and that also brings up the same question

65
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:16,879
what is it that we are all collectively trying to be and trying to create I

66
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,850
suspect that you all have the experience of falling short of the ideal an ideal

67
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,890
that you hold for yourself or an ideal that other people hold for you I suspect

68
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,019
that you all feel the negative consequences of falling short of that

69
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:43,439
ideal Freud would conceptualize that as the super-ego imposing its judgment on

70
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:53,579
the ego you being the ego the super-ego being a hybrid I suppose of external

71
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:04,620
forces and also your internalization of those judgments and forces now

72
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:15,600
personality per se I would say has these elements of ideal and has structural

73
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,750
elements of the way as well and we're going to talk about those more in the

74
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,110
second half of the class the structural elements can be lined up and outlined

75
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:31,490
more scientifically the second half of the class concentrates more on

76
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,229
physiology brain physiology and on statistical approaches to the

77
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,270
description of personality I suppose you might say that that outlines the

78
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,240
territory the course is called personality and its transformations

79
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,860
because we have personalities that's who you are now but our personalities are

80
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,100
also capable of transformation of change I mean obviously we think about that is

81
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,019
learning some of that might be regarded as

82
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:14,009
factual learning and some of it might be regarded as learning how to perceive and

83
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:22,379
behave and I would say that the clinical psychologists that will cover to begin

84
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:30,149
with are much more concerned with the nature of the implicit structures that

85
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,590
shape your perceptions and also the implicit structures that shape your

86
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:43,980
behaviors and how they're integrated in relationship to your negative emotion

87
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,009
health and well-being whereas the thinkers in the second half are more

88
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,090
concerned about laying out the structural elements of those features

89
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,570
and relating them to underlying se mechanistic phenomena making the

90
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Assumption which seems warranted that there's some relationship between your

91
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,379
personality and the manner in which your brain functions I'm going to try to

92
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:18,029
provide you with a meta-narrative that will help you unite these different

93
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,709
theories I've often found it useful when I'm trying to remember something to have

94
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,200
a story to hang the facts on otherwise you're faced with the necessity of doing

95
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,610
nothing but memorization and it isn't obvious to me that memorization actually

96
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:39,360
constitutes knowledge what constitutes knowledge is the generation of a

97
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,690
cognitive structure that enables you to conduct yourself more appropriately in

98
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,510
life and so I suppose you might say that of course in psychology you could argue

99
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:56,100
that a course in psychology especially in personality is a course in Applied

100
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,370
wisdom as well assuming that wisdom is in part your capacity to understand

101
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,279
yourselves so that you don't so that you don't present too much of an intolerable

102
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,850
mystery to yourself and also to understand others so that you can

103
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:20,909
predict their behavior understand their motivations negotiate with them

104
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:27,659
listen to them and formulate joint games with them so that you can integrate

105
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:36,860
yourself reasonably well with another person and with a family and in society

106
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,250
well the structural elements of personality might be regarded as the

107
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:50,370
implicit structures that govern your perception and that tilt you towards

108
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,779
certain kinds of behaviors I can give you some examples we can talk about the

109
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:00,929
Big Five model just briefly the Big Five personality model is a statistical model

110
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:06,509
which we'll cover in detail trade by trade partner partly during the second

111
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:13,080
half of the course the way that the Big Five was generated was that its tread

112
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,330
being generated over about 50 years that personality psychologists gathered

113
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,980
together adjectives with in the English language first that were used to

114
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:30,269
describe human beings as many adjectives as they could collect and then subjected

115
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,379
them to a process called factor analysis and what factor analysis does is enable

116
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,720
you statistically to determine in some sense how similar adjectives are to one

117
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:48,240
another so for example if you gave 1,000 people a list of adjectives to describe

118
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,139
themselves with and one of the adjectives was happy and another of the

119
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,740
adjectives was social you'd find that those who rated themselves high unhappy

120
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,549
would also rate themselves high on social and those who rated themselves

121
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:08,099
low unhappy would also rate themselves low on social and by looking at those

122
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,659
patterns of covariation you can determine what the essential dimensions

123
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:19,500
are of human personality one of the dimensions is roughly happiness that's

124
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,440
extraversion another dimension is neuroticism it's a negative emotion

125
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,680
dimension so if you ask someone if they're anxious and they score high say

126
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,919
on a scale of 1 to 7 they're also likely to score

127
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,379
on another item that says that they're sad and it turns out that negative

128
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,700
emotions clump together and so that people who experience more of one

129
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,770
negative emotion have a propensity to experience more of all of them there's

130
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:55,039
another dimension called agreeableness and agreeable people are

131
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,419
self-sacrificing compassionate and polite if you're dealing with an

132
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:06,449
agreeable person they don't like conflict they care for other people if

133
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,860
you're dealing with an agreeable person they're likely to put your concerns

134
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,340
ahead of theirs they're non competitive and cooperative it's a dimension where

135
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,350
women are women score more highly than men on agreeableness across cultures

136
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,269
including those cultures where the largest steps have been taken towards

137
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,230
producing an egalitarian social circumstance like Scandinavia actually

138
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,070
the gender differences in personality there are larger than they are anywhere

139
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:42,570
else another trait is conscientiousness conscientiousness is an excellent trait

140
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,100
if you want to do well in in school and in work especially if you're a manager

141
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,019
an administrator I can't say we understand a lot about conscientiousness

142
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,399
although it it reliably emerges from factor analytic studies of adjectives

143
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
groups across different countries conscientious people are diligent

144
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
industrious and orderly they're orderliness tilts them towards political

145
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,129
conservatism by the way because it turns out that your inbuilt

146
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,929
temperament your inbuilt personality which constitutes a set of filters

147
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:18,000
through which you view the world also alters the manner in which you process

148
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,789
information and influences the way that you vote and so you might say and I do

149
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,179
believe that this is true or we've been doing a lot of research on this as of

150
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:34,169
late the more accurate a measure you take of someone's political beliefs the

151
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:39,449
more you find that personality is what's predicting them and I think that's a

152
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,980
reasonable thing to think about because you know you have to you have to figure

153
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,730
out ways of simplifying the world right because you just can't do everything and

154
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,100
so people are specialized they have

155
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,970
specialized niches that they occupy you can think about them as social niches

156
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,810
can niche is a place where your particular skills would serve to

157
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:02,429
maintain you and so if you're extroverted you're going to look for a

158
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,519
social niche because you like to be around people and if you're introverted

159
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,759
you're going to spend much more time on your own and so if you're an introverted

160
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,189
person for example you're going to want a job where you're not selling and where

161
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,250
you're not surrounded by groups of people who are making social demands on

162
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,960
you all the time because it'll wear you out

163
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,310
whereas if you're extroverted that's just exactly what you want and so the

164
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,959
extrovert sees the world as a place of social opportunity and the introvert

165
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,180
sees the world as a place to retreat from and spend time alone and it turns

166
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:38,549
out that both of those modes of being are valid that the issue at least to

167
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:42,359
some degree is whether or not you're fortunate enough to match your

168
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,289
temperament with the demands of the environment and I suppose also whether

169
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,730
you're fortunate enough fortunate enough so that you're born in an era where

170
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,269
there actually is a niche for your particular temperament because it isn't

171
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:56,970
necessarily the case that that will be the case

172
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,820
imagine that all of these temperamental dimensions vary because of evolutionary

173
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,809
pressure right so there's a distribution of extraversion a normal distribution

174
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,589
most people are somewhere in the middle and then as you go out towards the

175
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,819
extremes there are fewer and fewer people and what that means is that on

176
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:21,389
average across large spans of time there have been environments that match every

177
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,259
single position on that distribution with most most of the environments

178
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,430
matching the center because otherwise we wouldn't have evolved that way and so

179
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,210
sometimes being really extroverted is going to work well for you in a minority

180
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,600
of environments a minority of niches and sometimes it's just going to be a

181
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,049
catastrophe I suspect for example that if you live in a tyrannical society

182
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:50,759
where any sign of of personally oriented activity is likely to get you in trouble

183
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,960
that being extroverted and low in neuroticism would it be a very good idea

184
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,670
because you're gonna be mouthy and happy and saying a lot of things unable to

185
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,278
keep your thoughts to yourself and you're going to be relatively

186
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:06,058
fearless now I don't know that for sure because we've haven't done the studies

187
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,829
that precisely match temperamental proclivity to environmental demand but

188
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:16,288
you get what I mean so conscientious people anyways

189
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:21,329
conscientious people are industrious and orderly we know a little bit about

190
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,858
orderliness it seems to be associated strangely enough with disgust

191
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:29,460
sensitivity which I suppose isn't that surprising you know if you take an

192
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,769
orderly person then you put them in a messy kitchen they respond with disgust

193
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:38,878
and want nothing more than to straighten it all out and organize it and clean it

194
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:44,998
and there's tremendous variability and orderliness and as I said orderliness

195
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,389
predicts political conservatism it's not the only thing but it's certainly one of

196
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:56,908
the things the correlation between conscientiousness and and grades is

197
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:02,759
about 0.4 it's about 16% of the variance it's it's the second best predictor of

198
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,538
university grades after intelligence and we'll talk about intelligence during

199
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,278
this course too intelligence is actually a relatively straightforward concept I

200
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:15,598
don't think I'll get into it today but conscientious people they're

201
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:19,588
industriousness and they're orderliness makes them schedule their time so they

202
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:23,278
make efficient use of their time they use schedules and that sort of thing we

203
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:27,028
haven't been able to figure out anything about the underlying biology or

204
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:32,929
psychology of industriousness we've tried really dozens and dozens of tests

205
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:38,399
attempting to find a laboratory measure on which industrious people do better

206
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:42,238
and we failed completely and there's no animal models of industriousness either

207
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:46,259
and so I would say it's a great mystery that remains at the heart of trait

208
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,569
psychology and maybe it's a human specific category you know I mean you

209
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:55,439
can think of sled dogs maybe of being industrious and maybe and maybe sheep

210
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,798
dogs and animals that work like that but of course they've been trained by human

211
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,348
beings so but it isn't obvious that animals are industrious the same way we

212
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,829
are I mean industriousness involves

213
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:12,239
sacrificing the present for the future something like that and you seems like

214
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,230
you have to be able to conceptualize time in order to sacrifice the present

215
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,048
for the future one of the things that I would recommend that you do as students

216
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,660
in this course and maybe in every course speaking of industriousness is come up

217
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,820
with a plan of attack for the course and use a scheduler you know if you treat

218
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,649
your university career like a full-time job you're much more likely to succeed

219
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,200
and if you keep up on the readings and you keep up on the on the essays and all

220
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,808
of that then you're much less likely as well to fall into despair when you get

221
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:53,399
too far behind using a Google Calendar or something like that to organize a

222
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,720
schedule for the entire semester at the beginning of the semester can be

223
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,940
invaluable especially if you're not very industriousness very industrious because

224
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,298
it can keep you on track and one of the things we know about industrious people

225
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,650
is that they are very good at using schedules and at planning the use of

226
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,330
their time and so I would like to say that you should all be smarter but I

227
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:19,230
don't know how you could be smarter we don't know anything about how to improve

228
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,679
intelligence and I suppose we don't really know anything about how to

229
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,030
improve industriousness either but I can tell you that people who are industrious

230
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:32,099
come up with a strategy for solving the problem that's ahead of them and then

231
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,789
they do whatever they can to stick to the strategy and so for example if you

232
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:42,000
sat down today or tomorrow for a couple of hours three hours and you filled in a

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,548
google calendar whatever you happen to use with a strategy for studying and a

234
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:51,480
list of when all your assignments are due and all of that and when you're

235
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,650
going to sit down and study then you won't be in a position where you have to

236
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,380
cram for 10 hours a day hopelessly right before you know an important exam it's

237
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,549
also a very ineffective way of studying by the way I mean first of all people

238
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:08,730
who cram for 10 hours say they're studying for 10 hours but they rarely

239
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:15,029
are because well I can't study for 10 hours I don't have the power of

240
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,779
concentration that would enable me to do that for that prolonged period of time

241
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,859
I can manage about three hours of intense intellectual activity before I'm

242
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,779
pretty done and it's also the case that if you study and then sleep and then

243
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,118
study and then sleep and then study and then sleep

244
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:34,978
you space it out then you're much more likely to remember it's also much more

245
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,369
likely that you're you're much more likely to remember if you try to recall

246
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:42,509
the material and so highlighting and that sort of thing isn't very useful but

247
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,189
reading closing the book summarizing what you've read without opening the

248
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:51,589
damn book that's useful and the reason for that is that you're practicing

249
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:55,759
remembering and that's what you have to practice if you're practicing

250
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,969
memorization you have to practice remembering you don't just go over the

251
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:02,999
thing over and over that'll help you with recognition memory

252
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:08,159
but some but it won't help you with recall memory so anyways the last trade

253
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,929
is openness openness is a creativity trait it's also associated with

254
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,429
intelligence in that intelligent people and I'm speaking technically of IQ tend

255
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,369
to be higher and tend to be more creative which is hardly surprising

256
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,158
creative people are more likely to be liberal politically by the way they like

257
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,539
novelty they like aesthetics they like fiction they like movies they like art

258
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,239
they like poetry there is something about them that grants them an aesthetic

259
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:45,389
sensitivity and and that's a that's an inbuilt trait and it's not the case by

260
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:49,408
the way that everyone's creative in fact far from it we've used the creative

261
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,939
achievement questionnaire to to measure people's creativity I'll talk to you

262
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:58,288
about that later in the class and the creative achievement questionnaire takes

263
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:04,408
13 dimensions of creativity so you know writing dancing acting scientific

264
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,369
investigation entrepreneurial activity architectural activity cooking there's a

265
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:15,358
there's a handful of others singing etc you know the sorts of things that you

266
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:19,618
would assume that people could be creative about and then it asks people

267
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:24,618
to rate themselves on a scale from one to ten on their level of achievement

268
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:28,908
with regards to all those creative domains with zero being I have no

269
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:35,278
training or proficiency in this area and 70% of people score zero across the

270
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,638
entire creative achievement questionnaire a tiny proportion of

271
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:42,418
people are outliers way out and they're creative in many dimensions

272
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,350
simultaneously and it exceptionally creative and it turns out

273
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:49,649
as you'll find out that that pattern which is called a Pareto distribution

274
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,630
where most people stack up at zero and a few people are way out on the creative

275
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,890
end characterizes all sorts of distributions like the distribution of

276
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,640
money for example which is why 1% of the people have the overwhelming majority of

277
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,669
the money it's a different 1% across time it like it churns and you're much

278
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,559
more likely to be in the 1% if you're older logically enough because one of

279
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,389
the things you do as you age is you trade youth for money if you're

280
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,288
fortunate I don't think the trade is really worth it but that's the best

281
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:31,349
you've got so anyways those particular traits you can think of those as ways

282
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:35,668
that you simplify the world right there's lots of different places that

283
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,480
you can act in the world and there's lots of different ways you can look at

284
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,190
it and survive that's why you can be a plumber and a lawyer and an engineer and

285
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,019
those all work right even though they're very different modes of being and you

286
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:54,109
can have different personalities and survive as long as you're capable of

287
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:59,639
finding the place where your particular filters and behavioral proclivities

288
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,230
match the demand of the environment and a huge part I would say of successful

289
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,679
adaptation is precisely that now there are other elements of personality too

290
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,370
one of the things that I've been struck by and this is actually one of the

291
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:17,969
criticisms I have of the psycho analysts and the clinicians in general even

292
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,779
though I have great admiration for them and would say that what they have to say

293
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:27,269
is very much worth listening to is that it's not obvious that your personality

294
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:33,269
is inside you you know what you think you know a human being is a strange

295
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:37,200
multi-level thing and you might ask yourself well for example

296
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,529
know is your mother more a part of you than your arm or maybe even more

297
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:48,658
precisely is your child more a part of you than your arm it's certainly people

298
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,730
will do drastically self-sacrificing things to maintain the lives of their

299
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,019
children and so you're you're a person and you're made out of all sub

300
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,190
sort of subcomponents of a person none of which you could see when you look at

301
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,970
a person all the complicated machinery inside you that makes you who you are

302
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,860
and then outside of that of course you're nested in all sorts of complex

303
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,669
systems so you're part of a family and and you're part of a community and

304
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,330
that's part of a province and that's part of the state and that's part of an

305
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:23,970
international consortium of states and that's part of an ecosystem and how you

306
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,120
make a distinction between you and the systems that you're embedded in is also

307
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,289
of extraordinary difficulty and when it and one of the things that you have to

308
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,230
do as a clinical psychologist for example if you're trying to diagnose

309
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,130
someone with depression you think you think well this person's dreadfully

310
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,630
unhappy well you can think about that as a problem with their psychological

311
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,610
adjustment you know the way that they're looking at the world but if you look at

312
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:55,799
the epidemiological literature for example one of the things that you find

313
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,680
is that very many people have a first depressive episode after something

314
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,519
genuinely terrible has happened to them right they've lost someone or they've

315
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,569
become injured or or they've become unemployed because unemployment is a

316
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:14,669
terrible shock to people and it's not precisely self-evident that you can

317
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,390
consider someone who's unhappy and desperate because they no longer have a

318
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:26,280
job depressed they're certainly sad and they're not doing very well but the fact

319
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,809
that they no longer have an income is actually something with dramatic

320
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:37,099
practical consequences and treating that as if it's a mental disorder seems to be

321
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:42,269
counterproductive it's also the case for example that if you're if someone comes

322
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:47,549
into you to talk to you and they're very upset and they may manifest the signs of

323
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,200
say an anxiety disorder or again depression or other other clinical

324
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,509
features for that matter you have to do a careful analysis of their manner in

325
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:01,230
which they're embedded in their family because and this is something that we'll

326
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:07,620
talk about quite thoroughly when we come to discussing Freud is that well you

327
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,949
know it's not like everybody's families are necessarily particularly happy

328
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,950
places to be you know I mean human beings are very

329
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,620
dependent we have a very long period of dependency partly because we're so

330
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:22,919
cortically hyperdeveloped it takes a very long time to program us into

331
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,170
something that's vaguely capable of maneuvering on its own and that produces

332
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,670
of course the very tight familial bonds that we all that we all desperately

333
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:39,120
require because who wants to be alone in the world but it also it also exposes us

334
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:45,209
to the probability of becoming entangled into even multi-generational family

335
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,850
pathology and it isn't obvious always uncertainty hasn't been to me when I've

336
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:55,799
seen my clients that the fundamental problem with the client is the client

337
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:05,099
sometimes the fundamental problem is is the family and and perhaps that person

338
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,149
has been identified as the problem person it's rather convenient for

339
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,390
everyone who's involved to make that presupposition it's also the case that

340
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,980
this is the Freudian idea fundamentally this is the eatable idea that it's very

341
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,360
easy for people to become over dependent on their parents and and for the parents

342
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:30,539
to facilitate that and then for the primary developmental problem for the

343
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:38,940
individual in fact to become free of the interfering elements of the family so

344
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,250
that they can exist as independent individuals well and then of course

345
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,109
there are cultural variations in that that make that proposition complex but

346
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:55,319
that's a fundamental tenant say of Freudian psychology a lot of the

347
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,929
clinical psychologists all of whom that we're going to study have a pronounced

348
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,330
Western orientation one of the fundamental presuppositions is that part

349
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:10,740
of the hallmark of positive psychological development is the

350
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,720
creation of an individual that's capable of acting independently and that's I

351
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,190
would say an implicit ideal that lurks at the bottom of the clinical

352
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:26,090
presuppositions of all the theorists that are classic psychologists

353
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:35,490
so now it's a very old picture it's Jonah

354
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:42,750
emerging from the whale it's a variant of a myth the myth is the dragon myth I

355
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,269
suppose the dragon myth is that there's a dragon that lives under the ground

356
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:54,630
that's eternal and now and then it rises out of the ground to threaten the state

357
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:02,549
and someone within the state determines to go confront the dragon voluntarily

358
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:08,609
and does so and then brings back something of great value sometimes if

359
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:14,879
the the the hero is generally male sometimes the thing of great value is a

360
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,950
female that the dragon has kidnapped that's a st. George story and sometimes

361
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:26,130
it's gold another treasure like in the story of The Hobbit and story that you

362
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:32,450
all know very well it's a classic hero story and the hero story is another

363
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,080
fundamental element of the clinical theories I would say it's predicated on

364
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:44,250
the idea that you learn through voluntary contact with that that

365
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:50,788
frightens or disgusts you and that's a hallmark of psychoanalytic theory young

366
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:57,000
Carl Jung who will discuss in detail said his primary dictum was in Starck

367
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,278
wiliness in Vinit or which I'm sure I'm

368
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,069
massacring because it's Latin but it meant in fill that will be found and one

369
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:09,119
of the hallmarks of the clinical theories is that within the confines of

370
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,069
everyone's experience and you can think about this as experience out in the

371
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:21,538
world or experience in the unconscious mind there are dirty little secrets

372
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:32,940
let's say and skeletons and dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse and memories

373
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,100
of pathological behavior and failures of courage that you leave you undeveloped

374
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:47,509
perhaps out of avoidance and that the psychoanalytic process is precisely the

375
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:54,360
careful encounter with those forgotten and and repressed elements of the self

376
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:01,469
in the hope that a clear encounter will redeem them unites them with the

377
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,989
remainder of your personality and make yours make you stronger in consequence

378
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:11,490
and I would say that that's just a variant of the manner in which human

379
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,858
beings learn and we'll talk about this more in relationship to Piaget because

380
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:22,739
you always learn when you're wrong which is very annoying now what do you learn

381
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,128
when you're correct you you're walking in the world you're operating in the

382
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:31,798
world you have a sense of what you want to have happen you're always looking at

383
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:35,730
the world through this sense of what you want to have happen you're acting so

384
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,519
that what you want to have happen will happen and when it happens well then

385
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,628
you're happy because well first of all you get what you want and that's good

386
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:50,548
maybe depending on what you want but it's also good because if you get what

387
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:55,168
you want when you act then it turns out that your model of how to act is valid

388
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:58,259
right the outcome that you get what you want

389
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,690
indicates no error on the part of your model but it's very frequently the case

390
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:10,048
that when you act to get what you want you don't get what you want and then

391
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:14,730
that's unpleasant because you don't get what you want but it's even more

392
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,990
unpleasant because it brings with it the hint of a suggestion that the manner in

393
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:25,769
which you're construing the world is incorrect at some indeterminate level so

394
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:33,088
for example if you tell a party tell a joke at a party you presume that people

395
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:38,190
will attend and then when they hear the joke they will laugh and then if you

396
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:44,460
tell the joke and it goes flat or even worse disgusts and offends people then

397
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,659
you're going to be taken aback and that's partly because you didn't get

398
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:53,219
what you want and that's not so good but it's but it's more because there's

399
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:57,419
something wrong with the way you conceptualized the situation and then

400
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,740
you're faced with a problem and the problem is the emergence of a domain of

401
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:05,189
the unknown it's like well what kind of mistake did you make

402
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,400
maybe you're not as funny as you think you are not that could be a big problem

403
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,269
maybe you're not around people that who are the way you think they are maybe

404
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:19,369
they don't like you as much as you thought they liked you I mean the

405
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:25,380
potential for various paranoid thoughts of increasing severity to come welling

406
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,809
up at you in a situation where you make even a trivial social mistake is quite

407
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:36,389
broad and when you make an error of that sort you have to face it and sort

408
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:41,039
through all the possibilities so that you can find out what it was that you

409
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,750
did wrong and how to retool it so that in the future you don't make the same

410
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,489
mistake and that requires well that requires in some sense what you might

411
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:53,969
describe as a journey into the belly of the beast the beast being that place

412
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:58,319
where things have fallen apart and where you're overwhelmed with negative emotion

413
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,510
and chaos and confusion and that's a very old story that's the story of the

414
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,500
journey to the underworld and the hero is the person who makes the voluntary

415
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,820
journey to the underworld to collect what's been languishing down there and

416
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,580
that's the basic motif of psychoanalytic theory I would say it's the basic motif

417
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,949
in some sense of clinical practice because one of the things that you do as

418
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:29,250
a clinician is find out what people are afraid of and what they're avoiding and

419
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,380
that can be in their past or in their present or in their future break it down

420
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,380
into smaller pieces and help them devise strategies of approach and mastery and

421
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:48,180
that improves the quality of their personality and helps develop them into

422
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:55,519
people who won't make the same mistakes over and over again all right so well

423
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:04,349
why these this plethora of tools well I said in some sense being a personality

424
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:09,350
psychologist is like being an engineer you're trying to build better people

425
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:15,989
when you might say that if you're a carpenter or a mechanic that your

426
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:21,659
ability to fix a vehicle or build a house is dependent on your proficiency

427
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:26,849
with regards to the use of a multitude of tools and so then you might say well

428
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,829
the more tools you have at your disposal the more likely it is that you're going

429
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:37,079
to manage things properly and so what I would like to offer you is the

430
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,069
possibility that what you're going to encounter in this course is a series of

431
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:49,100
sophisticated conceptual tools that will help you understand yourself better and

432
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:54,480
therefore better orient yourself in the world I regard this course as intensely

433
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,539
practical and that's because I believe that you have nothing to rely on in your

434
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:08,039
life that's more crucial to your success as you move through life than your

435
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,889
character and your personality that's what you bring to every situation and

436
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:18,900
the more sophisticated you are in relationship to yourself and others the

437
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,730
more you understand people the deeper you understand the nature of your own

438
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:29,340
being the more likely it is that you're going to proceed through your life in a

439
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:36,440
manner that will make you pleased to exist rather than displeased to exist

440
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,139
I've collected the writings of people that I regard as of incomparable

441
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:48,900
brilliance they're difficult to understand their concepts are complex

442
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,269
but it's not surprising because the subject matter is complex and vital and

443
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:59,789
so it requires work and I would say try to keep up on the readings if you would

444
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:04,500
it's going to make the course much more much richer for you and I would say

445
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,429
because people often ask me well how should I read for this course because

446
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:15,119
there's a lot of reading and the answer is read as if it matters that's the

447
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,059
right answer don't be thinking about how it's going

448
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,909
to be tested if you do the readings and you come to the lectures then

449
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:27,719
the tests aren't particularly difficult but you should read the readings as if

450
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,068
the person is writing about you and you should try to understand what the person

451
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:37,440
says because it's another tool for you to use and I would say well with my

452
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,759
clients you know I used the approaches of one theorist for one client and the

453
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:45,088
approaches of another theorist for another client it seems to me to depend

454
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:49,078
to some degree actually on the temperament of the client I found for

455
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,950
example that people who are very high in openness which is the creativity

456
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:58,558
dimension are quite amenable to a Jungian approach whereas people who are

457
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,849
more practical conscientious lowe and openness are much more amenable to a

458
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:07,798
behaviorist approach we don't really know enough about psychology yet to

459
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:13,489
match treatment to temperament but those are the some of the things that I've

460
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:21,598
experienced ok practicalities well there's a website I gave you the URL

461
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,130
I'll put it up again at the end of class the URL lists all the readings that

462
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,599
aren't in the textbook and so the textbook contains the classic readings

463
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:39,450
readings from people like Jung and Freud and Piaget and so forth Rogers and as I

464
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:44,338
said I picked that particular textbook because I believe that the author did a

465
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:49,048
very credible job of summarizing what's very difficult to summarize so and then

466
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:54,989
also on the website there are links to papers because much of the more modern

467
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:59,459
material that pertains say to neuroscience and also to trade

468
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,869
personality I think it's better just to read the original papers and I'll detail

469
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:07,920
them out with you as we go through and that'll also give you some familiarity

470
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,039
with original psychological papers which are again there's a there's an idiom

471
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,109
that you have to master in order to understand them but you might as well

472
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:23,219
practice it especially if you're interested in continuing with psychology

473
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:29,449
in your educational practice or as a career it's good to get accustomed to it

474
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:32,449
so

475
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,889
there again is the URL for the class if you go to Jordan be Peterson comm which

476
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:43,210
isn't too hard to remember assuming you can remember my name then

477
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:49,949
classes are listed on the left hand side you can just find the syllabus there

478
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,019
alright so here's what we're going to cover well today obviously this is the

479
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,559
introduction and overview the class is a little strange this year because one day

480
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,099
it's an hour and the next day it's two hours so not exactly sure how we're

481
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:07,920
going to negotiate our way through that but we'll figure it out

482
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,480
historical perspectives mythological representations well I told you that I

483
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,909
would try to provide you with a meta-narrative that might enable you to

484
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:22,149
link the theories that we're going to talk about together so I'm going to

485
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,430
describe to you what you might regard as a conceptual language and as far as I

486
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:31,539
can tell it's that imagine imagine that there are two kinds of things that you

487
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:36,820
need to know and I believe this to be the case I believe that you need to know

488
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,650
what the world is made of and I suppose that's the proper domain of science but

489
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,389
then you need to know how to act and that's a whole different thing and you

490
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,599
need to know how to act that's the thing you need to know most of anything

491
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,969
anything because of course you're a living creature and action in

492
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,409
relationship to desired goals is is everything to you and you can think

493
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:03,309
about that from a Darwinian perspective you have to act at least so that you can

494
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:09,400
survive at least so that you can find a partner that's that's life and so part

495
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,630
of the question is well how does the world look if you think about it as a

496
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,680
place to act and the answer isn't a place of value free objects that's not

497
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:25,269
what the world looks like and you can't act in a world of value free objects

498
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:29,739
because there's no way of choosing between them if everything has zero

499
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:35,019
value why would you choose one thing over another you live in a world where

500
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:40,269
things present themselves to you as of different value and that's partly a

501
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,690
consequence of your temperament although it's a consequence of other things and

502
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,108
so what I'm going to try to do is to provide you with

503
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:53,768
schema that describes the world of morality roughly speaking which is how

504
00:44:53,768 --> 00:44:58,508
to act and tell you a little bit about what I think the languages which I think

505
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,338
was derived from Darwinian processes and I believe that it's within that

506
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:07,900
structure that the clinical theories logically nest and so that'll give you a

507
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,400
way of linking one theory to another from a conceptual perspective without

508
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,289
having to rely so much on sheer memorization then we'll talk about

509
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:21,069
heroic and shamanic initiation and the reason we're going to do that is because

510
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:26,139
well people people used shamanic initiation for tens of thousands of

511
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:29,889
years all over the world and they have a particular kind of structure the paper

512
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:34,389
by merchant Le ADA which is linked on the site is a very interesting one and

513
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:38,920
details out some of these processes there have been intelligent commentators

514
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,509
like Andre Ellenberger Burge a who wrote the discovery of the unconscious which i

515
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:48,420
think is an outstanding book who late the processes that the psychoanalyst

516
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,650
psychoanalysts uncovered in the late part of the 19th century an early part

517
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,838
of the 20th century back to these more primordial rituals of personality

518
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:05,498
transformation and so we're going to situate ourselves in some sense in deep

519
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:10,778
history talking first about the underlying mythological landscape then

520
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:15,309
talking about archaic modes of personality conceptualization and

521
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:20,859
transformation and then moving from there into constructivism and and we're

522
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:23,980
going to concentrate mostly on Jean Piaget who is a developmental

523
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,690
psychologist constructivists believed that you make yourself out of the

524
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,710
information that you gather in the world so you're an exploring creature you

525
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,880
explore specifically when the maps that you're using in the world are no longer

526
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,269
orienting yourself properly when they're producing errors so you go out and

527
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:44,858
gather information and assemble yourself from the information that you discovered

528
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:51,130
then the depth psychologists Jung and Freud I think I'm going to with Jung I'm

529
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:57,579
going to walk you through some films I'm not going to use the film's per se I'm

530
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,940
going to use Clips stills from the film but

531
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,729
in you know the film so in in chronological order and I'm going to try

532
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:12,818
to explain to you how you might use Union presuppositions to understand what

533
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:16,449
the films are about you know if you think about a film say like The Lion

534
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:21,038
King which is an extraordinarily popular film it's a very strange phenomena that

535
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,160
you go and watch it right I mean think about it

536
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:31,328
it's drawings of animated animals that in some sense represent you they're very

537
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:37,359
low resolution but you perceive them immediately as living things and you

538
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,400
attribute to the motivation and and and motive power and understanding you do it

539
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,420
automatically without even thinking about it and there's a classic plot that

540
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,309
lies underneath those stories and the plots are very very very very old and

541
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:55,329
that's why you can understand them and the reason you can understand them is

542
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:59,528
because life has a plot or maybe it has a couple of plots a multitude of plots

543
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:03,099
but life has a plot and if it didn't we wouldn't be able to understand each

544
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:08,140
other and so I'd like to illustrate that for you by analysis of some of these

545
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:12,998
films I think it's the best way to understand someone as sophisticated as

546
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:17,858
young who is very difficult to get a handle on Freud I'm going to do the same

547
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:20,858
thing all the way I'm going to show you a film with Freud I'm going to show you

548
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:26,440
a film called crumb which is a documentary and it's about a very badly

549
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,719
enmeshed family and the attempts of the family members to I suppose escape that

550
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,690
I'll talk to you about Freud I'll show you the film that should give you a

551
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,559
sense of Freudian psychopathology which is a very difficult thing otherwise to

552
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,170
understand then there's a midterm a midterm is multiple-choice you'll do it

553
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,969
in class you'll have lots of time to finish it it'll cover the material that

554
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:53,349
we took that we studied up to that point then we're going to talk about Rogers

555
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:59,890
Carl Rogers who was a humanist Rogers has a body-centered philosophy I suppose

556
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:04,150
and he's interested as well in optimal personal development and the role that

557
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,920
interpersonal communication plays in that Rogers hypothesis fundamentally and

558
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,599
it's a very interesting one is that honest communication between two people

559
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,900
can produce personnel transformation and and you know you

560
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,920
might think well you kind of know that already because there's something very

561
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,240
engaging about a deep honest conversation where you're able to say

562
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,348
things that you wouldn't normally say where you're being listened to by

563
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:32,950
someone who's actually listening to you and you're listening to them and in the

564
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:37,419
conversation you're moving both of you further to a different point that's

565
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,088
different than a conversation where you're right and you're trying to

566
00:49:40,088 --> 00:49:43,989
convince me or I'm right and I'm trying to convince you which I would say is the

567
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:49,629
typical conversation the the healing conversation is more well what's up with

568
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,869
you you know how are you doing what how is your life going where what sort of

569
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:56,380
problems are you facing what do you think about those problems can you

570
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,800
conceptualize what a solution might be is there a way we could figure out how

571
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,269
to get there you know what's so it's a problem-solving conversation and it's

572
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,509
predicated on the presupposition that the person that you're conversing with

573
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,490
has the capacity to grow in a positive direction if they so choose that's the

574
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:17,579
fundamental that's the fundamental presupposition of Rogerian psychology

575
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:23,710
man Frankel are also humanists all finish tell you what the rest of the the

576
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,429
rest of the material is the next time that we meet I should show you let you

577
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:30,940
know a little bit more about the structure of course the second midterm

578
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:39,880
is March 14th the and there's a final at the end as well so the mid the

579
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:47,170
multiple-choice tests are graded in that manner 25% 25% in 27.5% they're not

580
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:52,809
cumulative each test only covers what you covered before since the last test

581
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:58,599
including the final you'll be required to write an essay of 15% it's a thousand

582
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,300
words sorry not 750 words and you'll also do an online exercise a personality

583
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,119
analysis which is pass/fail all you have to do is complete it and show proof of

584
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,710
completion it helps you do a modified Big Five analysis of your own

585
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:20,230
personality concentrating on your virtues and your faults so that so so

586
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,990
it's a it's an active exercise in the application of personality theory to

587
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:32,318
personal development and so that's the that's the structure of the course I can

588
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:42,009
tell you there's a sign-up sheet on the on the syllabus we I've broken the

589
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,640
essays down into multiple types across the entire semester I would highly

590
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:50,920
recommend that you go there and sign up there are limited slots for each topic

591
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,818
and the reason for that is well I don't want my TA to have to grade 200 essays

592
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:58,690
the last week of classes we have to spread them out across the year so

593
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:04,000
figure out a topic and sign out please and please do that sooner rather than

594
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,789
later it's it's an industrious thing to do it'll help you organize yourself I'll

595
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:13,690
post something that's quite useful about how to write especially a thousand word

596
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:20,650
essay and I'll close the essays are due one day before class I'll close by the

597
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:27,130
way by telling you who shouldn't take this course okay first of all if you

598
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,420
didn't like this lecture and don't take this course because this is what the

599
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,309
lectures are going to be like so and it's they're not for everybody

600
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:40,838
oh you used a lot of loose associations and try to gather them back in and I

601
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,699
kind of wander around that way I can talk directly to you which I like doing

602
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:50,529
but I sacrifice a certain amount of organization for that but my sense is

603
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:56,290
that it's worth the sacrifice the second thing is there's a lot of reading a lot

604
00:52:56,289 --> 00:53:02,318
and a lot of it is I would say a lot of it's hard science the last half in

605
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,000
particular but the first half of a lot of its philosophical in nature

606
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,079
philosophical / psychological and so if you're not interested in that

607
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:16,510
like if you're a pure science type and you're not interested in the clinical

608
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,339
elements say of personality and in the end in investigating the philosophical

609
00:53:21,338 --> 00:53:24,940
underpinnings of those clinical theories then I would say this isn't the course

610
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,409
for you and so you should take that seriously because the readings are hard

611
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:33,068
there's a lot of work involved in this course and it would be better if you

612
00:53:33,068 --> 00:53:38,440
took a course that you actually wanted to take so well welcome to psychology

613
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,568
230 and we'll see you in a bit you

614
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:55,849
you

1
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,714
so I want to tell you

2
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,585
I want to make a little announcement first.

3
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,335
I'm going to do a series of lectures, I think, starting in May.

4
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:23,195
Maybe at the Isabel Bader Theatre?

5
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,274
We're trying to look into booking that.  On a, I'm

6
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:29,274
going to do a psychological interpretation of the bible from beginning

7
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:32,464
to end.  That's the plan anyway.  So I'm going to do that once a week.

8
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,655
So if you are interested in that,

9
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:38,104
I would recommend that you... (and maybe your not an that's fine obviously)

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,944
but, if you go onto my Twitter account

11
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:43,935
you can just, there's a place you can sign up

12
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,075
It doesn't mean that you'll attend. I'm just

13
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:48,295
trying to see if there are people who are interested.  I've been

14
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,155
interested in doing that for a long time and so I think I'm going to try it and so.

15
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,155
Anyways!

16
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:55,565
That's the announcement.  Then, is that about it?

17
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:58,634
I guess so.  OK! So look we are going to switch gears today.

18
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:01,825
Um.  The first half of this course, as you've

19
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:04,975
no doubt already err gathered, is...

20
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,714
because it's grounded essentially in clinical theories

21
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,415
of personality it tends more

22
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,715
towards the philosophical.  And I told you that the reason for that was that

23
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:15,635
I regard clinical psychology as a branch of engineering

24
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:17,984
rather than a branch of science.

25
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:21,015
It's Human Engineering obviously; and because of that

26
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,715
it's an applied science and so that means it straddles the

27
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:26,585
ground between a science and a practice and

28
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,204
and it,  because it's, it

29
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:31,534
involves human beings,

30
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:34,474
it necessarily involves value because

31
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,934
we live inside value structures;

32
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:39,715
and so the logical consequence of that is that

33
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,045
investigation into the philosophy of value

34
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:45,094
is necessary in order to understand clinical

35
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,454
Psychological theories.

36
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,924
Because really what you are trying to do as a clinician,

37
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:52,075
you could say that you are trying to do two things; one is to help people

38
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,165
have less terrible lives.  But you are also trying to help them

39
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,305
have better lives. and there is obviously a value structure

40
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,375
that is inherent in that attempt

41
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:03,545
because you are moving from something of less value to something of more value

42
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,135
and so.. and it's best to just

43
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:09,354
to face that and all the complexities

44
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:12,224
that come along with that, head on. Now!

45
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:13,715
I think that what you do as a clinician,

46
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,104
to overcome what ever tendency you might have to

47
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,134
impose your value structure on someone is you do an awful lot of listening

48
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:22,435
And so my basic practise with people

49
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,295
is to say to them.  "Well; obviously you are here

50
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:28,334
because you would like things to be better. But that's OK.

51
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,474
We can use your definition of what constitutes better.

52
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:34,704
We can use your definition of what constitutes worse.

53
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,265
Or we can establish that through dialogue, and negotiation.

54
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,824
What are you aiming at? How would you like things to be better

55
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,734
a year from now say?  If you could have what you wanted,

56
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:47,247
if your life was put together what would that look like?

57
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,755
And you can have a very straight forward

58
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,844
discussion with people about that if you are not cram

59
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:55,875
the way that they are orienting the world into your particular perspective.

60
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,724
Now.  That's one of the dangers of being the adherent of

61
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:01,560
a given psychological school.  Now having said that.

62
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,400
It's also...

63
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,875
There was research done many  years ago, showing that

64
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,824
if you were an eclectic psychotherapist

65
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,814
which means that you sort of pick and chose from different therapeutic schools.

66
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:15,794
You tended to not be as effective as you were if you were the

67
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,474
dedicated adherent of a given school

68
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,064
and I think that the reason for that is

69
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:24,094
that there are so many schools of psychological thought

70
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:27,014
that if you say that you pick an choose from all of them, what that

71
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,364
really means is that you don't know anything about any of them.

72
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,435
And then there's also the additional

73
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:31,775
factor

74
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,064
(maybe, you might call it) that

75
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:38,379
if someone comes to you and they're very chaotic and confused.

76
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,000
Helping them impose ANY STRUCTURE

77
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,359
onto their life is likely to be an improvement over no structure at all.

78
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,474
And you can think about that in a Piagetian sense, is that

79
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:50,604
you know youâ€™re going to be happier playing a game, rather than no game.

80
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:53,514
And there's many games that you can play

81
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:56,544
that are better than no game.  And so if you go to

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,405
a therapist that has a particular view point

83
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,405
and they help you structure your understanding of the world

84
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,145
within the confines of a given clinical model;

85
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,405
and you came in there very chaotic and uncertain,

86
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,400
then maybe that's going to be a lot better for you than just floundering.

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,460
And I think that there's some real truth in that.

88
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,175
And I think that that's part and parcel of the same, er;

89
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,495
of another, what, you might call it

90
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:21,535
"reasonable observation about maturation" is that

91
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:24,415
it's very necessary for people at some point in there life

92
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,220
to dedicate themselves to a single game, of some sort.

93
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,780
Which is kind of what you are doing at University.

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,640
You Know, you have to become 'one thing' at some point in your life;

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
and the sacrifice of course is that you give up all the other things that you could become.

96
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,139
But you don't really have a choice because

97
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,419
if you don't decide voluntarily to become one thing.  You know

98
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,720
to become a disciplined adherent of some specific

99
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,065
er

100
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:51,084
practise or profession or view point

101
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,080
then you risk just ageing Chaotically

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,240
And you don't get away with not ageing.

103
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,014
So you might  as well age into something

104
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,159
that's actually something

105
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,520
rather than just  becoming an old child

106
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,300
Which is really... Which is not a good thing.

107
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,694
It's not a good thing to see.  Especialy when people

108
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:11,685
hit about 40.  It's not, it's not pretty,

109
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,595
For them or anyone else.

110
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
And even at 30, it's getting pretty old at that point.

111
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,959
40; it's like almost irreparable at 40.

112
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:22,774
And the reason for that is, you start running out of opportunities

113
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,564
when you're young and stupid people don't care

114
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:28,634
because they think, you know, whatever.  You've got decades of

115
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,139
of possibilities still ready to unfold in you,

116
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:37,379
but if you are in the same unspecified position at 40

117
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,519
people are much less forgiving

118
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,074
especially if they are going

119
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,479
to hire someone who doesn't know

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,600
what's going on.  Or employ them or sorry engage them is some sort of

121
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,125
productive activity.

122
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,714
They might as well take a chance on someone young and full of

123
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,685
potential rather than someone

124
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,584
who has really lived more than half of their life already

125
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:58,435
because of course you have, by the time you are 40. OK.

126
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:01,464
So, anyway, so that is with regards to putting the first

127
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,139
half of the course to bed so to speak.

128
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,259
The second half

129
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,214
is more scientific.

130
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:09,935
and there is a bit of a gap and

131
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,975
it's a bit of a gap I am trying to resolve conceptually

132
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:15,915
because now we move into more biological models

133
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,935
and into models that are psychometric and Psychometrics

134
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:21,954
is the psychological study of the study

135
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:25,014
of psychological measurement. And now if you are a scientist

136
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:27,394
there's a couple of things that you are

137
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,774
obliged to do if you are a scientist

138
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:32,644
one is to utilise the scientific method that's usually the

139
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,079
experimental method where you take 2 groups

140
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,014


141
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:38,794
randomly selected, apply a

142
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,564
manipulation to one of them and not

143
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:44,235
equivalent manipulation of a different sort to another;

144
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,985
hypothesize about what the outcome is likely to be and then test it

145
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,155
ah, that's the technical experimental model anyways

146
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:53,224
you're also obliged as a scientist

147
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:56,435
to come up with

148
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,555
a measurement of your, of your

149
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,514
to come up with a measurement, let's just put it that way

150
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,394
that's reliable and valid. Okay, and what a

151
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,724
reliable measure is one that measures the same way

152
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:11,220
across multiple measurements. So, for example,

153
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,120
you wouldn't want to take a ruler that's made out of flexible

154
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,340
rubber to measure things with because it

155
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,414
wouldn't give you the same measurement if you put it in different situations

156
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:23,915
That's reliability, and it's a term you need to know. It means that the

157
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:26,944
measurement tool produces stable results across

158
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:30,004
different instances of the measurement. Without that,

159
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,319
you don't have a measurement. And the other

160
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,259
critical

161
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,014
factor with regards to

162
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,714
a measurement is that it has to be valid, which means that

163
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,745
it actually has to measure what it preports to measure and it

164
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:46,745
actually has to be usable for an array of

165
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:49,785
different purposes as a consequence, so,

166
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,865
you might think well the purpose of scientific endeavor is to predict and to

167
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:56,115
control, you could say understand, predict, and control but

168
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,425
understanding, prediction, and control are all

169
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,914
manifestations of the same underlying

170
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:06,225
throughly designed comprehension. Now,

171
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:10,495
here's what's happened with the measurement of personality

172
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,495


173
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:12,904
It's a funny

174
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,360
story in some sense, a peculiar story, because

175
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,419
in many ways, what we've come to understand about personality

176
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,620
from a scientific perspective, developed

177
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,920
in a very atheoretical manner. It's not very common

178
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,000
in scientific endeavor that that occurs, is that

179
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,764
what we know about personality emerged

180
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,154
from, I would say, statistically rigorous observation,

181
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:39,555
without it being the consequence of any real model.

182
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:42,475
So, often, what happens,

183
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:47,305
in scientific endeavor is that someone generates a model first, a theoretical understanding,

184
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:50,194
and then they generate measurement tools based on that theoretical understanding

185
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,145
and then they test the measurement tools to see if

186
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,954
well if the measurement tools perform properly, and if they

187
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,034
fail at least to invalidate the underlying theory

188
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:01,444
That isn't what happened with psychometrics.

189
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:05,335
Except in a loose way, so here's the loose

190
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,205
theory, and you've got to get this exactly right

191
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:11,235
to understand this properly. You've got to get it exactly right, and it's

192
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,595
really important, because, insofar as you guys

193
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,745
are interested in psychology, especially in the

194
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:18,774
experimental end of psychology, measurement is everything

195
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,745
and so much of what psychologists publish and

196
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,644
write about is incorrect, and the reason it's incorrect

197
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,644
is cause they do not have their measurements properly

198
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,215
instantiated. It's a massive

199
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,605
problem especially in social psychology. In fact it's

200
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,465
probably a fatal problem, in that most of the things that

201
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,384
social psychologists measure don't exist.

202
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:40,194
And social psychology has been rife with scandals for the last

203
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:43,235
4 or 5 years, and there's good reason for it

204
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:46,305
but a big part of the problem is is that, the measurement

205
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:49,595
that people are not stringent and careful enough about their measurements

206
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:52,644
so we're going to walk through this very very carefully, so I'm going to

207
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:55,514
set forward a set of propositions and you have to

208
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:58,375
think about it, cause each of them are...they're axiomatic, so you

209
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,154
sort of have to accept them before you go on to the next step.

210
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,919
And there's certainly room to question them.

211
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,379
But here's the bare bones of the psychometric model of personality

212
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:10,365
so we'll call it roughly the big 5 model

213
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,105
and the reason it's called the big 5 model is because

214
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,465
the psychometric investigations have indicated that

215
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:18,534
you can specify human personality along 5

216
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,414
basic dimensions. You might ask well what

217
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,679
exactly is personality, and well

218
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,659
that's partly  what we have been trying to wrestle with in the entire course so far

219
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,314
and I would say

220
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:32,305
umm what exactly is a trait. Think of an trait as an element of

221
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:35,339
personality; and I think the best way to think about a trait is

222
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,379
as a sub-personality.

223
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,980
So you are made up of sub-personalities

224
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:43,235
that are integrated into something

225
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:45,154
vaguely resembling a unity. But the unity is diverse.

226
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,240


227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,560
There are describable stable elements that characterize you.

228
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,059


229
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,479
That are elements of your being.

230
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,555
So for example, here are some common ones.

231
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,995
I would say, are you so sure ,or would you rather be alone?

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,039
So here is a good question for you to define

233
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,939
decide whether you are an extrovert or an introvert.

234
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,399
It's pretty straightforward. It is the first major dimension.

235
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
Basically if you take any set of questions,

236
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,220
about, any set of questions that

237
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,259
could be applied descriptively to a human being,

238
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,715
and you subject them to a statistical process

239
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,519
called factor analysis.

240
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,720
You can determine how they group together. So, what I would be interested in,

241
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,420
Let's say I ask you a hundred questions.

242
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,840


243
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:33,945


244
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,855


245
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,925


246
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,524


247
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:45,694


248
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:48,294


249
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,634


250
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:54,804


251
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:57,974


252
00:11:57,975 --> 00:11:59,825


253
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:02,815


254
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:05,855


255
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:09,024


256
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,865


257
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,334


258
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,475


259
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:21,414


260
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:24,424


261
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,344


262
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,495


263
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:33,424


264
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:36,375


265
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,225


266
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,254


267
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:45,245


268
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,485


269
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:49,845


270
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,384


271
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,835


272
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,365


273
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,404


274
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:04,384


275
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,754


276
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,774


277
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:12,954


278
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,925


279
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:19,125


280

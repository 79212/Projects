'naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .', \"however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .\", \"because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .\", 'mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .', 'most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .', \"brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .\", \"david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .\", 'women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .', \"catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .\", 'from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .', 'photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .', 'on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .', 'although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .', 'the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .', 'he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood .', \"to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .\", 'however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .', 'according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .', 'this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .', 'in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .']),\n","        list(['pos', 'pos', 'pos', 'pos', 'pos',
